            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>The good acceptance whereof, with the mercie and prouidence of God therein conſidered, (Right Honourable) mooued mee the rather to make an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere vnto ſome ſuch demands, as haue been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded vnto me here in my fatherland, about the

fruitfulneſſe of that good land, where are the vpper ſprings and the nether ſprings, which it hath pleaſed God to alot to the <hi>Othoniel</hi> and <hi>Achſah</hi> of our times, the ſonne in law, and daughter to <hi>Caleb,</hi> the the nobleſt Prince and longeſt liuer of all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael, who hath ſeene the Lords wonders and deliuerances, in Egypt, the red Sea, Wildernes, and land of Promiſe, (Preſerue them ſtill, O Lord, from all the Canaanites, &amp;c. among whom they liue, and make them all for ſtrength of body, wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, conſtancie and yeares like vnto <hi>Caleb,</hi> and with <hi>Othoniel</hi> to ſubdue the enemies of Iſrael.) And not hauing any better meanes then this, whereby to giue content, I haue now preſented my little cake, and offered my two mites, to the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants and treaſurie, being all that I had. The former being, A faithfull Admonition of the Prince Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor Palatines Churches, aduiſing to vnity. And this, A full Declaration of their faith. So as that this is not onely an Apollogie of the former, as appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in the 8. Chapter: but is able to giue full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to all ſuch honeſt people as deſire to know what to truſt to in them For which end they firſt publiſhed the ſame, as appeareth in the 1. Chapter, and which I only aimed at in tranſlating it. For as for peace haters nothing wil ſatiſfie them, God-fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring people then finding what they ſeeke for, I truſt none will blame mee for that I haue taught it to ſpeake Engliſh in ſo plaine a ſtile; the Lord know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I haue done it ſo faithfullie as poſſibly I could.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:25112:6"/>The cauſes moouing me to bee ſo bold as to put your Honors cogniſance vpon this Prince Electors man, are for that it hath pleaſed God to mooue the heart of our dread Soueraigne to aſſigne your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour a generall charge to doe iuſtice to the oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and to defend the fatherleſſe, the widow, and the ſtranger. And therefore as I ſerued in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer to the Table of the Right Honourable <hi>Oliuer</hi> Lord <hi>S. Iohn,</hi> as a diſh of Reniſh Grapes, that ſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might the more willingly taſte thereof, ſo by your Honours good acceptance alſo of this tree in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your Orchard, it may ſpread it ſelfe the further in the vineyard which God hath planted in this Iſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

And though he be now ſo homely apparrelled in an Engliſh ſhepheards weede, the fault thereof is to be aſcribed to me, for I aſſure my ſelfe had a <hi>Ionathan</hi> got his acquaintance he would haue honoured him more, yet as he now is, I truſt your Honour ſhall reape no diſgrace by him, for he was borne in <hi>Iſhaies</hi> houſe, and he is ſtrong, valient and wiſe, and the Lord is with him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as he fought with the Lion and the Beare in his father-land, ſo dare he (with his 5. ſmooth ſtones ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the Lords brooke) encounter <hi>Goliah</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abroad, if he heare him blaſpheme the Lord and his hoaſt: which he ſhall be the better able to doe, and himſelfe take no harme, being ſo honourably har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.

Who now alſo is more feeling of a ſtrangers caſe then your Honor? But why doe I ſtill call him a ſtranger? the whole citie knowing that hee is a vertuous man, and a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolite, and therefore hath not onely taken our God for his God, but our people for his people: ſurely the heart of none but <hi>Marah</hi> will refuſe him. Yet whatſoeuer entertainment he finds, yea although it ſhould bee ſuch as may diſcourage him, hee hath kept the words of Gods patience, and done that which appertained to him: and he will not for all that diſpaire, or renounce the confeſſion of the truth (as Prince <hi>Frederick</hi> of bleſſed memory did formerly anſwere thoſe that thought to daunt him) though the whole world ſhould leaue him.

better aduiſement, hee is ſo farre from patronizing ſuch paradoxes, that none is more contrary vnto them then himſelfe is: theſe were ends of the firſt writing this booke.</p>
            <p>And as for the tranſlating, it wanteth not lawful and commendable vſes: for, firſt we may here ſee, what cauſe we haue to bleſſe God for the religeous care of our dread ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne, in matching his only daughter a princeſſe peere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe, with a Prince of that ſoundneſſe in religion as the Prince Elector is: thereby diſcouering his ſingular loue to the truth, and his vpright heart to God: when as nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maſſes of treaſure nor height of honour did ſo much preponder at in his royall heart, as did true religion, and the aduancement of the Goſpel, and the glory of God. What is to marry in the Lord, if this be not? and what can be a truer token of a religious heart then this is? policie, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celleth to ſtrengthen ſtates and kingdomes by conioyning them together by marriages. And in this reſpect not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religion is often not regarded, but euen natures law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, as experience ſheweth in many places of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and eſpecially in the houſe of <hi>Auſtria.</hi> But our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeous Soueraigne eſteeming it no policie but vanitie, which is not grounded vpon the feare of God, the roote of true wiſdome, hath preferred true religion aboue all; and laboured to ſtrengthen himſelfe rather in the Lord, then in the world. Albeit there be neuer the leſſe no diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in that happie match, either in honour, he being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from Kings and Emperours, and the principall Elector Emperiall. Or in wealth and power, his dominion being both great and large, able to anſwere his ſtouteſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in the face, if need ſhould require, or in gifts of nature, of which this whole land, and eſpecially Cambridge graced
<pb facs="tcp:25112:9"/>
by his highneſſe preſence are eye, and eare, and heart wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes: notwithſtanding, religion was his Maieſties chiefe motiue: and ſo being, it giueth vs all his ſubiects that feare God, cauſe both to praiſe God for his Maieſties happy raign ouer vs, and to lay downe our liues and goods at his feet to giue him contentment: and to pray to God with earnest deuotion for the continuing of his life and raigne. As alſo to hope that as his Maieſty hath begun this firſt happy ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his royall iſſue in the Lord, ſo hee will not ſwarue from the ſaid rule in the ſecond, of him who is the breath of our nostrels, and the only radiant ſtarre of our horriſon.</p>
            <p>Secondly, this Treatiſe may ſerue to aduertiſe vs that we are not alone in the profeſsion of our faith, nor doe ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate our ſelues from other reformed Churches: but ioyne the hands of fellowſhip and friendſhip with the Churches of Germany; yea of France, the Low-Countries, Denmark and all other reformed Churches of the world, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer they differ from vs in ſome ceremonies; yet in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of faith, we runne all one way, and mind one thing. And touching Ceremonies, being nothing but externall accidents and ornaments of religion, that they are not ſo obſtinately maintained by any of vs, as if the life of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould conſist therein: or that we are not ready to alter and change the faſhion of them if neceſsitie, either in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of charitie or ſcandall ſhould ſo require. And as for the difference betwixt the Lutherans and Caluiniſts, that they are not ſo great nor ſo many as our aduerſaries would make them, and as the world take them to bee: excepting onely a few ſtrange poſitions broched &amp; defended by ſome of a more rough and bitter ſpirit of that ſect; who as they ſwarne from the ſtandert of their Captaine <hi>Luther,</hi> ſo are
<pb facs="tcp:25112:9"/>
condemned of their owne pewfellowes, to whom God hath vouchſafed a more mild and peaceable heart. This is plainely diſcouered in this booke; and not onely this, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with what ſpirit of meekeneſſe theſe good men, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of this booke, are inſpired, who being reuiled, ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and contumeliouſly railed vpon, by thoſe rough and rigid falſe diſciples of <hi>Luther,</hi> reuiled not againe, but after the example of Chriſt referre the righting of their wrongs to him that is the rightfull Iudge of heauen and earth: and by all gentle and louing perſwaſions labour to winne them to the truth.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, it may ſtand vp as a bulwarke, againſt the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious ſlanders of our rancored aduerſaries the Ieſuites, and other of the Romiſh crew, and this as in many pointes, ſo eſpecially in theſe two: that the Proteſtant Church for want of a viſsible Iudge indued with infallibillety of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and impoſsibilitie of erring is rent and torne in pee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces into ſo many ſectes, as there are particular Churches, and almoſt perſons. And that we, if not profeſſedly, yet by conſequents, hold this damnable doctrine, that God is the author of ſinne: both which ſlanders are ſo clearely diſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this tract, that none can chooſe but ſubſcribe to the ſame, who is not either mufled with ignorance, or blinded with mallice. For touching the firſt, here they may ſee, how though we be diſioyned by diſtance of peace, yet we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord together in the vnitie of one truth, and that all diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences amongſt vs, are almoſt onely in ſuch matters, as concerne not the life of religion, but the exteriour ſhape and garment thereof. And this by the guidance of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſible head <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and his bleſſed ſpirit of truth, in better and in a more excellent maner, then they by their
<pb facs="tcp:25112:10"/>
viſible Iudge the pretended vicar of <hi>Chriſt</hi> vpon earth. And touching the ſecond, that neither directly wee teach, nor indirectly may bee deduced from our doctrines, that God is the author of ſinne, is ſo euidently and ſincerely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered in this booke, as none that readeth the ſame with aduiſement can but account our aduerſaries notorious cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniaters to lay ſo ſoule a crime to our charges vpon ſo ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a ground; but no maruell, ſeeing ſlandering and lying is one of the chiefe pillars of their kingdome. Theſe bee the profitable vſes, that may be made of this booke, Now the God of all mercie direct all our thoughts, words and works, to the aduancement of his glorie, and the edification of his Church. And thus commending this booke to thy fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable acceptance, I commend thee to the grace of <hi>Chriſt Ieſus.</hi>

Now we for our parts are not only readie to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace peace continually, and for that ende haue tried all meanes to purchaſe the ſame, whatſoeuer any Chriſtians are bound to doe therein: but ſo there are alſo many God fearing people on the aduerſe part, both of high and low degree, who deſire peace as gladly euen as we doe, and would further it to the vttermoſt of their powers, who alſo acknowledge that the meanes thereto propounded by vs <hi>(that we, namely, whileſt we agree in the foundation of faith, ſhould not condemne each other for difference in opinion about by-queſtions: conſidering that it is vnpoſſible in this life, that the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and vniforme confeſſion of all the miſteries of God, ſhould be holden by all members of Chriſt in all things: as the Scripture witneſſeth, and experience hath alwaies ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted)</hi> are Chriſtian, and agreeable to the word and will of God.

                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:25112:16"/>We beleeue further, though ſuch a fearefull fall,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> both of Angels and men,<note place="margin">Of the cauſe of mans fall.</note> could not haue come to paſſe without Gods permiſſion, and that hee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points nothing without good conſideration: yet is not the fault of this fall in any manner to bee aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to him; conſidering, that he ſo created the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men, that they had free will to turne to good, as well as to bad.</p>

               <p>Wee beleeue further, that though God permit <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> many ſinnes in the fallen Angels, and men, and that hee vſeth oftentimes their ſinfull actions to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh his holy workes, (as hee did the abominable deeds of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> to the puniſhment of <hi>Dauid;</hi> and the treaſon of <hi>Iudas,</hi> to the freedome of mankinde) alſo though he often puniſh ſinne by ſin, and blind and harden thoſe commonly at laſt, who with ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes will yet be blind, (as formerly he did <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>) yet neuertheleſſe he of himſelfe hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſinne, much leſſe doth hee prouoke or driue any man thereunto: but that the precedent wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king cauſe of all ſinne, which goeth before, is onely and alone the free and vnforced will of wicked An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and men.</p>
               <p>We beleeue further, that God hath adiudged the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> fallen Angels to euerlaſting fire, without any grace or mercy, to terrifie vs thereby; that we make not a ieſt of the anger of God againſt ſinne.</p>
               <p>Wee beleeue further, that God had indeed iuſt <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> cauſe and power alſo, to puſh downe the fallen men into euerlaſting helliſh fire, without any grace or mercy. But hee hath not done it; but hath offered grace again to man.

And when hee had liued as a man thirtie yeeres, he began to teach and preach, the mercifull pleaſure of his heauenly father to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards vs poore ſinfull men: And in the fourth yeere after that, he was captiued, crucified, put to death, and buried, deſcended into hell, and roſe againe from the dead the third day, and aſcended into hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, fortie daies after, and ſet himſelfe at the right hand of God the father Almighty; from whence he ſhall returne to iudge the quicke and the dead.</p>
               <p>And therefore we beleeue of Chriſt, that hee is not a bare man,<note place="margin">Of the perſon of Chriſt.</note> but that hee is the euerlaſting Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="13"/> Sonne of God, who at the appointed time tooke the nature of man vpon him, and is now to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether God and man, and ſo ſhall remaine euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtingly, in one vnſeparable perſon.</p>
               <p>And being thus at preſent both God and man,<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="14"/> in one vnſeparable perſon; therfore do we beleeue further, that all may be ſaid of him, that may be ſaid of God, and all that may bee ſaid of man; yet with this caution, that euery thing muſt bee vnderſtood of him to be true; the Diuine thing according to the Diuine nature, and the humane according to the humane nature. For example, it may bee ſaid of him, that hee is from euerlaſting; and alſo, hee was firſt borne in the laſt times, both are true, but not
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:25112:18"/>
both according to both natures. For according to the humane nature was hee not from euerlaſting. Alſo, according to the Diuine nature was hee not borne in the laſt times. But he is from euerlaſting according to the Diuine nature, and firſt borne in the laſt times according to the humane nature.</p>

                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> According to which then wee doe beleeue, that in deed and truth, the Sonne of God died for vs: but yet not according to the Godhead, but only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manhood: for the Godhead can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="16"/> Alſo wee beleeue, that indeed and truth, Chriſt is preſent with vs, and will ſo remaine to the end of the world, but yet not according to the humanity, but the Deity. For according to the humane nature is he aſcended vp into heauen. And the Scripture is manifeſt, which ſaith; <hi>That by the offering vp of his body, he muſt enter into the heauenly tabernacles, and not remaine vpon the earth: elſe were he not our Prieſt.</hi> Heb. the 8.9. and 10.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> Of the power of the death of Chriſt beleeue we, that the death of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Of the power of the death of Chriſt.</note> (whileſt hee being not a bare man, but the Son of God died) is a full and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient payment, not onely for our ſinnes, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſinnes of the whole world.

               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="18"/> But wee beleeue therewithall, that no man ſhall be made partaker of ſuch a benefit, but onely he that beleeueth in him. For the Scripture is plaine, where
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:25112:18"/>
it ſaith, <hi>He that beleeueth not ſhall be damned,</hi> Mark. 16.16. Alſo. <hi>Hee that beleeueth not in the Sonne of God, the wrath of God abideth on him.</hi> Ioh. 3.36.</p>
               <p>Wee beleeue further, that the true ſauing faith <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="19"/> cannot be without repentance, and good workes.<note place="margin">Of the nature of the ſauing faith.</note> For ſuch a faith layeth hold on Chriſt wholly, <hi>who was made of God not onely righteouſneſſe to vs, but alſo ſanctification,</hi> 1.

               <p>But for this cauſe will not God reueale our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="28"/> any otherwiſe then through ſuch teſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that we might not fall into fleſhly ſecurity, <hi>But work out our ſaluation with feare &amp; trembling,</hi> Phil. 2.2.</p>

nothing can ſeparate them from the loue of God which is in Chriſt Ieſus our Lord,</hi> Rom. 8.38. And it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that any where a man ſhould ſay from his hart, <hi>I beleeue to obtaine euerlaſting life:</hi> But all men muſt doubt of life eternall, if wee had not that comfort, that God had ſo bleſſed vs that beleeue in him,<note place="margin">1.

which amongſt many other vnfallible marke-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens, may bee heereby manifeſted. For where they ſaid (as they vſed to ſay) this or this hath the Lord ſpoken: there did the Lord confirme ſuch their ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that they were true, with great and vnaccuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med wonders before all creatures, and ſo giuen them teſtimony by his owne almightineſſe, that they ſpeake the truth, and that that in truth was his word, which they either ſpake or writ in his name.</p>
               <p>It is otherwiſe to be thought of <hi>Auguſtine, Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian, Hierome, Luther, Zwinglius,</hi> and other the like teachers, who roſe vp after the times of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles. They neuer publiſhed that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer God reuealed his word vnto them without meanes, much leſſe did they euer any where ratifie the ſame by wonderfull tokens; but haue alwaies in their Sermons and writings drawne their teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies out of the writings of the Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, as the vndoubted word of God: whileſt now they euer appealed to the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, and directed vs thither, as to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of their faith: therefore alſo neither can nor ſhall we doe otherwiſe then ſearch in the writings of the Prophets and Apoſtles, whether their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine bee founded thereupon or not.

their allegations go, and keepe only to Gods word. Would God that all thoſe that either will or ſhould iudge about the troublous contentions in religion, would well conſider this difference betwixt the word of God, and the writings of men. It would ſtand much better (a thing much to bee lamented) then it now ſtands in the Proteſtant Churches. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Luther</hi> of happy memory hath with this onely one difference confounded the whole Papacie.

Onely Gods word could not erre: therefore would not hee bee confuted and ſhewed by any thing but by Gods word. This was Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> anſwere againſt the Popedome. And all Proteſtant Churches acknowledge, that this his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere was right and good.</p>
               <p>If then Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> did well and right, that he would not bind himſelfe to any writings of men, but onely to the word of God; then can no man take it euill at our hands that wee herein follow his example, and alſo bind not our ſelues to any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of men, be he called <hi>Lutherus,</hi> or <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> or how he will, but onely to the word of God.</p>

               </p>
               <p>And alſo, ſuch a conſtruction followes not out of the word of God. Chriſt indeed ſhewed forth bread, and ſaid, <hi>This is my body.</hi> But it followes not of neceſſity, that he meant it ſo; as if he would haue ſaid, <hi>Therein is my body.</hi>

                  <hi>though ſeuerall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and words be there. The tokens and words are from time to time deliuered otherwiſe. But there remaines yet all one faith in the onely one God, who by ſeuerall tokens
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:25112:33"/>
and words deliuered at times, doe communicate one faith and ſpirit, and worketh in all the Saints of God by the ſame one manner of pardon of ſinnes, deliuery from death, and purchaſe of ſaluation; whether it bee in the beginning, middle, or end of the world. That is Pauls meaning here, that he fathers haue eaten the ſame food, and drunke the ſame drinke with vs: yet addeth he that word, ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, vnto it. For outwardly and bodily had they other to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens and words then we, but euen the very ſame ſpirit and faith of Chriſt which we haue. But to eate and drinke ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually, is nothing elſe then to beleeue the word and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens of God, as Chriſt alſo ſaith,</hi> Ioh. 6. <hi>He that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. Alſo, my fleſh is meate indeed, and my blood is drinke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed: that is, hee that beleeueth in me he ſhall liue. Alſo, they drunke of the ſpirituall rocke which followed, which was Chriſt: that is, they beleeued in the ſame Chriſt, in whom wee beleeue, although hee was not then come in the fleſh, but ſhould come afterward. And the token of ſuch their faith, was the materiall rocke, where they drunke of the materiall water; euen as wee by the materiall bread and wine vpon the alter, eate the true Chriſt ſpiritually, that is, in eating and drinking outwardly, doe wee nouriſh faith inwardly.</hi> Whileſt now theſe things are thus, and whileſt in all Sacraments there are ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſignes: as alſo the <hi>Apology</hi> of the <hi>Auſpurges Confeſsion</hi> ſaith, with the ancient Doctor <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> of all Sacraments; <hi>The Sacrament is a viſible word: for the outward token is a picture, whereby the ſame is ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified which is preached by the word, &amp;c.</hi> Seeing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſay wee) that there are ſignifications in all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:25112:33"/>
therefore it followes, that alſo this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſpeech hath place in all Sacraments, where one ſaith, <hi>This is this or that,</hi> when it is meant, <hi>this betokeneth this or that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither can any waighty cauſe be ſhowne wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my body,</hi> ſhould not euen ſo bee vnderſtood, as if hee had ſaid, <hi>this beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens my body,</hi> or, which is all one, <hi>this is a token or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, or calling to mind of my body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Out of which wee doe further conclude, whileſt the words of Chriſt, <hi>This is my body,</hi> muſt not bee ſo vnderſtood; as if he had ſaid, <hi>Therein is my body;</hi> but may well be vnderſtood ſo, as if he would haue ſaid, <hi>this betokens my body:</hi> that accordingly Doctor <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers</hi> opinion, where hee ſaith, that the body of Chriſt is in the bread, out of Chriſts words, where hee ſaid, <hi>This is my body,</hi> hath no neceſſary conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>And this is the firſt cauſe why wee cannot leane to Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion, about the reall preſence of the body of Chriſt, in the bread: namely, whileſt ſuch a conſtruction hath no ground in the word of God: it being ſo, that in neither ſtands expreſly in the words of Chriſt, neither can bee drawne from thence by any neceſſary conſequence.</p>
               <p>The ſecond cauſe, why we cannot yeeld to Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>Luthers</hi> aboue named opinion, is this;<note place="margin">The ſecond cauſe why we cannot leane to Doct.

               <p>For firſt of all, ſo witneſſeth Gods word cleerely,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:25112:34"/>
that Chriſt aſcended into heauen, fortie daies after his reſurrection, and at preſent is no more vpon the earth. <hi>I am no more in the world,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, Ioh. 17.11. And the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes ſhewes it ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry largely, <hi>that he muſt by the offering of his body, enter into the heauenly Sanctuary:</hi> And concludes therout, <hi>that therefore if hee were vpon earth, then were hee not Prieſt,</hi> in the 8.9. &amp; 10. Chapters. See Reader, this is the cleere and infallible word of God, that Chriſt is <hi>not</hi> any more bodily vpon earth: therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not the contrary that hee <hi>is</hi> now vpon earth, bee true.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the word of God witneſſeth cleerely that Chriſt hath once himſelfe renounced, and ſaid, that the bodily eating of his body is not profitable to ſaluation, <hi>the fleſh profiteth not,</hi> namely, to be eaten with the mouth, (as the Capernaites meant, that they muſt eate his fleſh,) Iohn 6.63. What now Chriſt hath once caſt away as vnprofitable to ſalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that is vnpoſſible that hee ſhould againe haue euer ordained it, as profitable to ſaluation. <hi>For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cals not his word: neither wil he rebuke himſelfe of lying,</hi> as Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> truly writeth, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 530. <hi>B.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, the word of God witneſſeth plainely, <hi>That Chriſt once dying for vs, henceforth dieth no more,</hi> Rom. 6.9.10. Therefore ſhall not his blood heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after bee ſeuered from his body any more really,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 529.</note> as Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion ſheweth. For hee ſaith, his body is in the bread without blood, and his blood in the wine without the body. This is as much as if he ſaid, that his body is dead in the Supper. For a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:25112:34"/>
body without blood is dead. Now his body can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die any more: therefore neither can the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> of the reall, and ſeparated preſence of the body of Chriſt in the bread, and his blood in the wine, be right.</p>

               <p>Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, the Sophiſters, (that is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 457.</note> the Popiſh Schoole-men) ſay, there are three maner of waies, to bee in a place.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. Firſt, our faith is not to bee grounded vpon the Schoolemen. Secondly, neither doe the ſchoole-men ſay, that any where one onely thing can haue three ſeuerall formes together of being in a place. But this ſay the Schoole-men: Euen as there are three ſeuerall things; bodies, created ſpirits, and God: euen ſo there are three ſeuerall manners of being in a place. For a body is in one place <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptiue,</hi> that is, ſo that it is compaſſed with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpace, and is neither greater nor leſſer then the place wherein it is; therefore alſo it is ſightly and comprehenſible. A created ſpirit is in a place <hi>defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue,</hi> that is, that it is moſt certainly there, but yet not comprehended in a certaine place, and needeth not a ſpace, but pierceth through wood and ſtone, as a ſound paſſeth through a wall. God is in all places, <hi>Repletiue,</hi> that is, ſo that hee filleth heauen and earth
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:25112:36"/>
with his preſence. This ſay the Schoolemen; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that theſe three ſeueral things: bodies, ſpirits, and God, haue three ſeuerall manners of being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. But that any where, one onely thing ſhould haue together all three aforenamed formes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhere, that haue the Schoolemen neuer ſpoken: neither yet did euer any man elſe ſpeake it. But Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> is the firſt that ſaid it.</p>
               <p>Therefore we haue reaſon to aske wherefore he ſaith it? and what ground he hath for it in the word of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Tom. <hi>3</hi> Jen. fol. <hi>457.</hi> B.</note>Hee ſaith, that wee cannot denie it, that Chriſt went through dores being locked<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; aroſe through the graue ſtone it being ſealed. Which hee muſt needs performe by the ſecond manner of being in a place, and ſo muſt he indeed be without ſpace and place: it ſo being that hee paſſed through the ſhut doore, and the ſealed graue ſtone, euen as a ſpirit paſſeth through wood and ſtone, or as a ſound for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth through a wall; or as the Sun-ſhine glanceth through a glaſſe window, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. It ſtands not written in Gods word, that Chriſt came to his Diſciples through locked doores: but only this ſtands in Gods word, that he came vnto them, <hi>when the doores were locked,</hi> Ioh. 20.19.26. Out of which it followeth not, that hee paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the lockt doores faſt ſhut, with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as a ſpirit paſſeth through wood and ſtone; or as a ſound through a wall, &amp;c. For <hi>Peter</hi> came alſo out of priſon, when the doores were locked, and yet neuertheleſſe he paſſed not through the ſhut dores:
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:25112:36"/>
but the doores muſt giue way vnto him, as ſtandeth expreſly written, Act. 12.10. <hi>When they were paſt the firſt and ſecond watch, they came vnto the iron gate that leadeth vnto the city, which opened vnto them of it owne accord, &amp;c.</hi> If now the doores muſt open to <hi>Peter,</hi> that he could go out of priſon without change and alteration of his true body; wherefore ſhould not much more all doores and ſtones giue place to the Son of God himſelfe, that ſo hee might paſſe where he would, without change and alteration of his true body? ſhould not the thing that is formed, giue place to the former? ſaith <hi>Hierome.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hier ad Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach.</note>
               </p>
               <p>And euen in like manner is it with the ſealed graue ſtone; though it cannot bee ſhewed that Chriſt did ariſe, till ſuch time as the Angell had rol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſame away; euen as <hi>Matthew</hi> expreſly wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, that he rolled it away, Chap. 28.2.</p>
               <p>It is beleeued alſo, ſaith Doct. <hi>Luther,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 460.</note> that Chriſt was alſo ſo borne of his mother.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. It is not euery where beleeued, and there is no neceſſity to beleeue it; for it is not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten any where in the word of God. This is written in the word of God, that Chriſt was conceiued ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturally without the helpe of man, only by the power of the holy Ghoſt. But that hee ſhould bee borne ſupernaturally, and come out of the body of his mother being cloſed, that ſtands not at all in the word of God: but much more the cleare contrary is written therein. For the Law is expreſly referred to Chriſt, which ſaith: <hi>Euery man child that firſt open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the wombe, ſhall be called holy to the Lord,</hi> Luk. 2.23.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:25112:37"/>
and what needeth much diſputing? Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe cleareth it, Luk. 24.39. where hee ſaith: <hi>Behold my hands and my feete, it is I my ſelfe, handle me and ſee: for a ſpirit hath no fleſh and bones, as ye ſee mee haue.</hi> By which words he moſt clearely ſheweth, that the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond manner of being ſomewhere, namely, to bee vnſeene, and vnpalpable, is not common to bodies, but belongeth to the ſpirits. Therefore this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the body of Chriſt ſhould be vnuiſible and vnpalpable as the ſpirits are, hath not onely no ground in Gods word, but is alſo flat againſt the ſame.</p>
               <p>And admit that it could bee ſhewed out of the word of God, that the body of Chriſt were at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent vnſightly, and vnfeeleable; yet were not the <hi>Contradiction</hi> which is betwixt the holy Scripture and Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion, where the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, <hi>hee is</hi> not <hi>at preſent more vpon earth;</hi> but Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, <hi>hee is</hi> yet <hi>now vpon the earth</hi>) nothing at all ended thereby. For the ſpirits alſo or Angels, though they bee vnuiſible, and not to bee handled, as they bee, yet neuertheleſſe are they but in one place at one time. Therefore if it bee true, as it is, that Chriſt is at preſent in heauen: then can he be no more vpon the earth after the ſecond maner, then after the firſt together at one time. And accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly the bodily preſence of Chriſt together in many thouſand places, (that is, in all places where the holy Supper is celebrated) by the ſecond man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of being in a place, (namely, as the created ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are in one place,) can neuer bee defended and
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:25112:37"/>
maintained. But will a man haue the bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt alike in many thouſand places, then muſt hee alſo of neceſſity aſcribe to the body of Chriſt the third manner: which manner is to be <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, wholly, and altogether in all places.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> confeſſeth, that this manner is proper to God onely. <hi>Tem.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 457. <hi>B.</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>This manner is onely aſcribed to God, as hee ſaith by the Prophet Ieremy: Am I a God at hand,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ier. 23.23.24.</note> 
                  <hi>and not far off? doe not I fill heauen and earth, &amp;c.</hi> See Reader, there Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> confeſſeth, and proues it by the word of God; that the third manner of being, (namely, to be wholly in all places) entirely belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to God himſelfe. And yet neuertheleſſe where he ſeeth,<note place="margin">Marke Reader the fountaine of vbiquitie.</note> that the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the bread of the holy Supper, cannot otherwiſe bee maintained by him, he lets the heate of contention, and deſire of the victory ſo farre beare ſway, that he addeth againſt the preſently forenamed knowledge and confeſſion of his owne, and ſaith: <hi>The body of Chriſt hath alſo the third manner vpon it of being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where,</hi> Tom. 3. fol. 459. 460. &amp;c. And clearer yet: <hi>The body of Chriſt is euery where,</hi> Tom. 3. Ien. fol. 457. <hi>And was at that time euery where, when hee walked vpon the earth.</hi> Tom. 3. fol. 354. 493. Alſo. <hi>Yea hee is in all places from his mothers wombe.</hi> Tom. 3. fol 464. Alſo, <hi>It is all through and through full Chriſt, euen according to the manhood,</hi> Tom. 3. Ien. fol. 458. Alſo, <hi>Heauen and earth is his ſacke: as the corne filleth the ſacke, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſo fils he euery thing.</hi> Tom. 2. Wit. fol. 115.

               <p>This is in truth a lamentable example, out of which one may ſee what contention can do, when one yeelds too much vnto it. It is alſo a ſufficient, &amp; more then ſufficient teſtimony, that the doctrine of the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the Supper can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be right. For what is right, that can alſo bee maintained with vpright grounds, as <hi>Sirack</hi> ſaith; <hi>The Law ſhall be fulfilled without lies, and wiſedome is ſufficient to a faithfull mouth,</hi> Chap. 34.8. Now can the doctrine of the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the Supper, neuer be maintained with found grounds. But if a man will maintaine it, then muſt hee take the falſeſt grounds to helpe him, which may bee thought of, to maintaine it, namely, the omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the body of Chriſt, as the reader ſeeth: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vnpoſſible, that ſuch a doctrine can be true.</p>
               <p>But ſome man might ſay, you haue not as yet proued, that the Omnipreſence of Chriſt is a falſe ground.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. What need is thereof much proofe, Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> hath at laſt himſelfe againe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and confeſſed:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Pag.</hi> 152.</note> as the Brunſwicks Diuines at the conference at <hi>Quedelburg,</hi> openly teſtified and with ſufficient documents explaned and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted. Alſo, moſt of the <hi>Lutheran</hi> Diuines doe at preſent acknowledge it: for all that, they former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vnderwrit the <hi>Concordien</hi> booke, which was
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:25112:38"/>
taken in hand to ratifie this opinion. And all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian men muſt acknowledge it; or muſt confeſſe that the whole ſtory of the Goſpel is falſe: yea that the whole Chriſtian faith is nothing, but a very meere ſight in a looking glaſſe. For a body which is euery where, can neither be conceiued nor carried in a body, nor borne into the world of ſuch a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther who is not euery where. Alſo, a body that is euery where, can neither bee captiued nor bound, nor carried from one place to another, nor be ſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, nor crucified, nor put to death, nor bee taken from the Croſſe, nor bee buried of thoſe who are not euery where, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>That muſt all Chriſtian men confeſſe. And all doe vniformely confeſſe it alſo; three or foure Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellers excepted, with whom wee hereof diſpute in vaine. For they know well aforehand, that they faile therein: and yet for all that, they will not giue the glory to God.

               <p>And thus much be ſpoken of the firſt contrariety betwixt Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion, and the holy Scripture. Which is, that the holy Scripture ſaith, the body of Chriſt at preſent is <hi>not</hi> any more vpon the earth: but Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, that hee <hi>is</hi> now vpon the earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Clearance of the ſecond contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety betwixt Doctor Luthers opinion, and the holy Scripture.</note>The ſecond contrariety is, that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, that the bodily eating of the fleſh of Chriſt, is <hi>not</hi> profitable, Ioh. 6. But Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, that it <hi>is</hi> profitable. <hi>Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Ien. fol.</hi> 82. 358. 464. 455. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This contrariety the better to ſalue vp, ſaith Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Luther.</hi> Where Chriſt ſaies, <hi>The fleſh profiteth not,</hi> Ioh. 6. That he there ſpake not of his fleſh, as if that were not profitable to be eaten with the bodily mouth: but he ſpake of our bad fleſh, that the ſame is not profitable.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. The whole <hi>diſputation</hi> with Chriſt held with the Capernaites. Ioh. 6. Chapt. is of his fleſh, how a man ſhould eate the ſame, and not of our fleſh, whether it bee bad or good. Chriſt ſaith, one muſt eate his fleſh, elſe could hee not bee ſaued. Whereat the Capernaites were offended, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the ſpeech of Chriſt ſo, as if his fleſh ſhould be eaten bodily. To remoue this ſtumbling blocke, Chriſt gaue them to vnderſtand, that it was not his meaning that his fleſh ſhould be eaten bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: for he muſt aſcend into heauen. Alſo, that the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:25112:39"/>
fleſh profited not. Theſe were the grounds where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Chriſt ouerthrew the bodily eating of his fleſh. How can Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> then ſay, that Chriſt did not ſpeake of his fleſh?</p>
               <p>He ſaith: <hi>his ground for it, is this:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tom. <hi>3</hi> fol. <hi>364.</hi> A.</note> 
                  <hi>that where the two words, fleſh and ſpirit, in the Scripture are oppoſed one to another, there cannot fleſh bee called the body of Chriſt, but is alwaies called that old fleſh, which is borne of fleſh,</hi> Iohn 3.</p>
               <p>Anſwere. This ground is manifeſtly falſe. For there are many places in the Scripture, where fleſh and ſpirit are oppoſed to the other, and yet therein the word fleſh is vnderſtood of the body of Chriſt, and alſo cannot bee any otherwiſe vnderſtood. As where it is ſaid: <hi>God is manifeſt in the fleſh, iuſtified in the ſpirit.</hi> 1. Tim. 3.16. Alſo, <hi>Chriſt was made of the ſeed of Dauid, according to the fleſh, and declared migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily to bee the Sonne of God, touching the ſpirit.</hi> Rom. 1.3.4. Alſo, <hi>Chriſt was put to death concerning the fleſh, but was quickend in the ſpirit.</hi> 1. Pet. 3.18. And alſo Doct. <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe, neuer otherwiſe expounded this ſaying of Chriſt, where he ſaith: The fleſh profiteth not, then we expound the ſame, when he contends not about the Sacrament: namely, the eating of the fleſh of Chriſt with the bodily mouth, not to bee profitable to ſaluation: as is to bee ſeene in ſeuerall writings of his.</p>
               <p>Firſt, in the Sermon on <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> day, printed in quarto, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1523. 36. leafe, where he ſaith: <hi>For euen ſo ſaith he, (namely Chriſt) himſelfe afterwards the fleſh profiteth not:</hi> And againe, <hi>my fleſh giueth life, how
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:25112:40"/>
ſhall we ſeparate that? the ſpirit ſeparates it. Chriſt will haue it, that the bodily eating of his fleſh is not profitable, but to beleeue that the fleſh is the Son of God, come downe from heauen for my ſake, and ſhead his blood for me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After, in the repetition of this Sermon in the Church Poſtill, printed at Wittenberge, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1527. in the Summer part, <hi>fol.</hi> 111. <hi>B.</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>But that this is the true vnderſtanding of the Goſpell,</hi> (name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it is to be vnderſtood of the ſpirituall eating and drinking,) <hi>the words which the Lord ſpake at the end of the Chapter doe ſhew: It is the ſpirit that quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, the fleſh profiteth nothing. The words that I ſpeake vnto you are ſpirit and truth. With which words Chriſt will haue vs know, that the bodily eating of his fleſh is not profitable: but to beleeue that this fleſh is Gods Son, come from heauen for my ſake, and ſhead his blood for me, that is profitable and is life euerlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alſo, againe in the Church Poſtill, <hi>Anno,</hi> 1540. printed at Wittenberge in the winter part, <hi>fol.</hi> 275. <hi>B.</hi> where he ſaith: <hi>When the word of God, and tokens are not there, or are not acknowledged, then helpes it not though God were there himſelfe. Euen as Chriſt ſaith of himſelfe,</hi> Ioh. 6. <hi>The fleſh profiteth not, ſo long as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect not the words which he ſpeaketh of his fleſh, which word makes his body to be food, where hee ſaith: hee is the liuing bread from heauen, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore alſo in this point the contrariety betwixt the holy Scripture and Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, is without No: namely, that the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, the fleſh of Chriſt bodily or mouthly eaten is <hi>Not</hi> profitable. Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> yet ſaith, the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:25112:40"/>
fleſh of Chriſt bodily or mouthly eaten, <hi>is</hi> profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. His followers take this refuge to helpe them: that in Ioh. 6. Chriſt ſpake only againſt the naturall groſſe Capernaitiſh eating of his fleſh, that it is not profitable.</p>
               <p>But euen that is alſo a vaine refuge. For firſt, Chriſt ſpake generally againſt all bodily eating of his fleſh, and oppoſeth that to his aſcenſion, &amp; ſaith: <hi>What then if ye ſhould ſee the Son of man aſcend vp where he was before?</hi> verſ 62. As if hee would ſay, how will yee then reach my fleſh with your mouthes? Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſo is alſo the difference betwixt the bodily and naturall eating in it ſelfe, falſe and of no worth. For the mouth cannot eate ſupernaturally, but all eating with the mouth is a naturall eating.</p>
               <p>And ſo the ſecond Contrariety betwixt the holy Scripture and Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion for all this, without No.</p>
               <p>The third Contrariety betwixt Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion, and betwixt the holy Scripture,<note place="margin">Clearance of the third contrariety betwixt Doctor Luthers opinion and the holy Scripture.</note> (as wee haue aboue touched) is this, that the holy Scripture ſaith, Chriſt once dying for vs, can henceforth die no more. Which is euen as much as if it ſaid: his body can be no more without blood, and his blood can be no more really ſeuered from the body, or be ſhead out of the body. But Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion brings this with it, that now euery day, namely, as often as the holy Communion is adminiſtred, that the body of Chriſt is without blood, and that the blood of Chriſt is really ſeuered from his body. For the bread is indeed ſeuered from the wine really.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:25112:41"/>
When now the body is in the bread, and not in the wine; and contrariwiſe the blood is in the wine, and not in the bread: then is it indeed manifeſt that they muſt be ſeparated really from each other. And Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> yeelds, that that is his meaning, where he ſaith: <hi>I am to know, that I receiue the body of Chriſt in the Sacrament without blood.</hi> Tom. 3. fol. 529.</p>
               <p>Vpon this Contrariety doe wee not finde any thing of reſpect, which Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> hath anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in his ſtrife writings. Neither doe wee ſee how it is poſſible to anſwere any thing groundedly; and therefore it remaines as it is.</p>
               <p>And this is now ſufficiently ſpoken, of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſe, why wee cannot giue approbation to Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion, about the bodily preſence of the body and blood of Chriſt, in the bread and wine of the holy Supper; namely, whileſt ſuch an opinion hath not onely no ground in Gods word, but alſo is manifoldly againſt the ſame.</p>

               </p>
               <p>From the witneſſes it is very manifeſt, that the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill cuſtome of the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the Supper, did not ariſe before ſuch time as that Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry got the maſtery. Wherefore cannot wee other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eſtimate ſuch a cuſtome but for a Popiſh lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen.</p>
               <p>About which no man hath any iuſt cauſe to wonder, that Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> who otherwiſe was a deadly enemy to the Popedome, did neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter this abomination of the Popedome. Euen <hi>Elias</hi> the Prophet alſo did not encounter the calues of Bethel,<note place="margin">2. King. 25.15.</note> which <hi>Ieroboam</hi> had ſet vp: but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained euen vnto the daies of King <hi>Ioſias:</hi> and yet neuertheleſſe they were Baalitiſh abominations. God hath ſuch a manner, that hee accompliſheth not all by one man, that ſo no man might be made an idoll, but muſt aſcribe the honour onely to him. And alſo there were outward cauſes which were a
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:25112:42"/>
hinderance to Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> that he could not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the true ground of this matter.</p>
               <p>For firſt, hee was borne and brought vp in the Popedome, and hee was a Frier full fifteene yeeres long, in which many yeers, and from his childhood the euill cuſtome of the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the bread, was ſo ſtrongly rooted in him, that he could not eaſily remoue it out of his heart after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. Euen as alſo many other Popiſh errours (as the Purgatory, Tranſubſtantiation, the <hi>Communion</hi> vnder one kind, and honouring of the Sacrament, calling vpon the Saints, &amp;c.) in the beginning of his <hi>Reformation,</hi> for certaine yeeres together cleaue faſt vnto him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, and whereas Doctor <hi>Carlſtadt</hi> would ſhew vnto him that hee failed in this point; then did not <hi>Carlſtadt</hi> onely bring it in very vnbefitting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that that he ſaid, that Chriſt with the word <hi>this</hi> pointed not to bread, but to his by-ſitting body at table, which Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> could eaſily confute him in, and ſo thereby he was more and more forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his opinion: but hee propounded it alſo in ſuch a rough manner, that it was no maruell that Doct. <hi>Luther</hi> would not receiue information from him.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, and for all that <hi>Zwinglius</hi> did afterwards propound the matter better and in behoofe fuller manner, then Doctor <hi>Carlſtadt</hi> had done, vſing ſuch waighty arguments, which might very well haue opened the eyes of Doctor <hi>Luther:</hi> yet neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe hee was ſo inflamed by the contention with
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:25112:43"/>
Doctor <hi>Carlſtadt,</hi> that for very anger thereof hee could neither ſee nor heare more thereabouts. As all his ſtrife writings teſtifie, wherein hee approueth or denyeth ſuch things, as no man can approue or denie, who is ſetled in his minde.</p>
               <p>For example. Whereas <hi>Zwinglius</hi> ſhewes him, that the word <hi>Is,</hi> often in the Scripture betokeneth ſo much as <hi>Calleth,</hi> as, whereas <hi>Ioſeph</hi> ſaith to <hi>Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh, Seuen kine are ſeuen yeeres, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas it cannot be denied; yet for all that, ere he will yeeld to <hi>Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> he denies it, and ſaith: <hi>The ſeuen kine did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token ſeuen yeeres,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 41.</note> 
                  <hi>but were really ſeuen yeeres,</hi> Tom. 3. fol. 443.</p>
               <p>Alſo, where <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> alleaged vnto him, that there were figuratiue ſpeeches very vſual in the inſtitution of the Sacraments, as in the inſtitution of the Eaſter Lambe, did God ſay: <hi>This is the Lords Paſſeouer, &amp;c.</hi> Where his meaning was, this is a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and remembrance of the Paſſeouer. Howſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer that alſo was vncontroleable, yet for all that ere he would yeeld himſelfe vanquiſhed, hee rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies it, and ſaith: <hi>It is not a bare figuratiue ſpeech in the inſtitution of tha Eaſter Lambe, and in all other figures of the old Teſtament.</hi> Tom. 3. fol. 477. B. Alſo, whereas <hi>Oecolampadius</hi> alleaged vnto him, that this ſpeech, when one ſaith, <hi>This is this or that,</hi> is often in effect as if one ſaith, <hi>This is a token of this or that:</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others alleaged the text, Geneſ. 17.10.11. where God ſaith of Circumciſion, verſ. 10. <hi>This ſhall bee my Couenant:</hi> and preſently thereafter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:25112:43"/>
his ſpeech thus, <hi>The ſame ſhall be a token of the Couenant,</hi> verſ. 11. Yet ere hee would approue <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lampadius</hi> therein, he denies it, that this text was in the Bible. For theſe are his owne words hereof: <hi>My Geneſis ſaith not</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>that Circumciſion is a coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and token.</hi> Tom. 3. fol. 478. B.</p>
               <p>And whileſt he ſaw that hee could not vanquiſh <hi>Zwinglius</hi> with ſufficient grounds, then tooke hee vpon him to ouerbeare him with heauie imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and ſaith, he denied the <hi>Communicationem idio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matum,</hi> that is,<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>3</hi> fol. <hi>250.</hi> B.</note> the Communion of the properties of both natures in the one onely and vnſeparable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt, as did <hi>Neſtorius;</hi> and taught, that not the Sonne of God,<note place="margin">Tom <hi>3.</hi> fol. <hi>462.</hi> B.</note> but onely a meere man died for vs, &amp;c. Which thing he knew very well, that <hi>Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi> neuer beleeued in all his life, but much more, that hee had teſtified and written many times the cleane contrary. This Proceſſe now giues ſufficient information, that Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> was wholly ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with anger in the handling heereof, and was not his owne maſter therein. And therefore let no man maruell that hee could neuer come vnto the true vnderſtanding of the truth thereof.</p>
               <p>And ſo much bee alſo ſpoken of the third cauſe, wherefore we cannot yeeld to Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, about the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Supper; namely, whileſt we ſee that ſuch an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hath no teſtimony from the ancient Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Churches, but was hatched firſt of all in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry darkeſt daies of Popery.</p>

                     <hi>4</hi> The fourth cauſe wherefore we cannot yeeld to Doctor Luthers opinion; namely, whileſt ſuch an opinion is the chiefeſt ground and foundation of Popery.</note>The fourth cauſe is, becauſe wee ſee that ſuch an opinion alſo at this preſent day, is the principall pillar and foundation of the Popedome. For the whole Popedome together with all his inuentions, poyſeth it ſelfe principally vpon the Maſſe. But the Maſſe conſiſteth onely and alone vpon the bodily preſence of Chriſt in the bread of the holy Supper. For if Chriſt were not there bodily, then acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Papiſts themſelues, that the Sacrament ſhould neither bee bowed vnto, neither ſhould or could a man offer vp God, for the ſins of the liuing and the dead. But when he is bodily there, ſay they, then cannot a man renounce the honouring with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſinning. And Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe writeth thus, <hi>Tom.</hi> 3. <hi>fol.</hi> 206. <hi>B.</hi> where hee ſaith: <hi>Whoſoeuer beleeueth not that the body and blood of Chriſt is there, he doth right, that he neither worſhipeth ſpiritually nor fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But who ſo beleeueth it, he cannot poſsibly deny him his worſhip without ſinne.</hi> Further, and if Chriſt be there bodily, ſay the Papiſts, wherefore ſhall not he be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered vp to God the father, or teſtifie and dare to pray, that he will be gratious to his folke for his ſake, This ſay the Papiſts. And it is vnpoſſible that any man can anſwere them with ſufficient grounds, ſo long as a man yeelds vnto them, that Chriſt is there bodily.</p>
               <p>Where we now ſee, that the greateſt idolatry of al, that euer was committed, and the whole ſtrength and power of the Popedome, dependeth vpon this one euill cuſtome, that Chriſt is bodily in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, ſhould wee not then neceſſarily loath

                  </note> wherefore wee cannot but loath ſuch an euill cuſtome, is this: for that we ſe that the ſame alſo doth procure no good in the Proteſtant Churches, but it leadeth the people daily more and more, from the right way to ſaluation, vnto the <hi>opus operatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> that is, vnto theſe perſwaſions, that they can be ſaued by the outward worke of the Sacrament, though inwardly, there be no liuing faith, and true conuerſion.

               <p>Now the God-fearing Reader may conſider, whether theſe fiue cauſes, which wee haue hitherto mentioned, bee not weighty enough to hold vs <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> from Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> opinion?

               <p>We truſt in God, that men of vnderſtanding ſhal acknowledge, that in this matter we hold the truth.</p>

Wherefore it is of neceſſity, that wee doe alſo ſhew our minds in theſe points: as we will preſently doe hereafter.</p>
               <p>But we muſt prepare the Reader aforehand, that
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:25112:46"/>
he may know how the calumniation aroſe, that it is ſaid, that our Religion is from the diuell, and that <hi>Zwinglius</hi> ſo confeſſed himſelfe, that his Religion was reuealed vnto him in a dreame, by a ſpirit, of whom he knoweth not, whether hee were white or blacke. Now then the eſtate of the buſineſſe was thus.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Zwinglius</hi> was come ſo farre by diligent meditation in the holy Scriptures, and eſpecially by the 6. Chapter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as alſo through daily ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the writings of the ancient fathers, that hee now doubted not any more of the true vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy Supper, according to the intent of Chriſt: he declared firſt of all the fame in writings and Sermons to the Churches of God, and after that hee entreated the Counſell of <hi>Zurick,</hi> that hee might publikely vtter the ſame vnto the <hi>two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</hi> Which being done, and audience affoorded him, hee propounded, that the worſhipping of the Sacrament, and the Maſſe ought to bee aboliſhed, and in ſtead thereof the holy Supper ſhould be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed and commanded, agreeable to the inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt: in conſideration, that now, bleſſed be God therefore, it was apparant, that the cuſtome of the corporall preſence of Chriſt, (vpon which the aforenamed abominations were founded) was falſe. For it was moſt cleere in the 6. Chapter of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that Chriſt had himſelfe caſt away the carnall eating of his body, as vnprofitable to ſaluation. And alſo the articles of the Chriſtian faith, were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtfull, which ſay plainely, that Chriſt is bodily
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:25112:46"/>

This was the drift of the ſpeeches of <hi>Zwinglius:</hi> which ſpeech indeed was well acceped of the greateſt number: but yet not of them all: but part of them gainſaid him.

And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, hee cauelled againſt thoſe examples which <hi>Zwinglius</hi> had alleaged to ſhew, that the word <hi>Is,</hi> is often taken in the Scripture for as much as betokeneth; ſaying, that thoſe examples agreed not with the cauſe in controuerſie. For they ſpake of parables. But in this was it not ſpoken of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but of the Sacrament. And howſoeuer that
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:25112:47"/>
                  <hi>Zwinglius</hi> gaue him preſently ſuch an anſwere, wherewith all men of vnderſtanding were well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, (as namely, that theſe ſpeeches, <hi>The ſeed is the word of God, the field is the world,</hi> were not parables, but expoſitions of the before going Parables: and if they were indeed Parables, yet did they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict his purpoſe. For hee would onely thereby make plaine, that it was not vnuſuall in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that the word <hi>Is,</hi> was taken for betokeneth. But that in like manner alſo it muſt bee ſo, that did not hee conclude from this example, but from the grounds aforenamed, that Chriſt had himſelfe caſt away the bodily eating of his fleſh, Ioh. 6. and that hee were not at preſent any more bodily on earth, but in the heauens; according to the article of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith. For all which, whileſt ſome weake ones, were brought into a mamuring by this allegation, touching parables, the Councell held it for good, that the next day they ſhould come together again, and ſhould well conſider the matter as it behoued. And <hi>Zwinglius</hi> was very well content therewith, and in the meane time hee thought further on the ſame. And whileſt hee perceiued that it depended principally vpon this, that hee ſhould produce ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, wherein there were no parables, and yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertheleſſe the word <hi>Is,</hi> was taken for betokeneth, hee was very much troubled in himſelfe, where hee might find ſuch an example. And when hee found none before night, and went to bed with ſuch a troubled mind, in the night that he had this dreame which we now following, not with our owne, but
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:25112:47"/>
with his owne words, will make manifeſt:<note place="margin">Tom. <hi>11.</hi> Zwing. fol. <hi>249</hi> in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidio de Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtia.</note> which truly tranſlated, are as followeth.</p>
               <p>It was amongſt others not the leaſt trouble, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that I ſhould bring examples, in which there were no parables. Then thought I heere and there, and ſearched euery where; but could find no other example, beſides thoſe which I had already publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed in my booke: or if I found any, then were the ſame parables. But when the 13. day of Aprill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proched, (I tell the truth, and it is ſo certainly true that I tell, that my conſcience enforceth mee alſo, that I muſt declare it, though I had rather not vtter it. But I muſt vtter what the Lord hath imparted vnto mee, though I know very well what ieſts and mocks will be made of me for it,) when as now, the 13. of Aprill approched, I thought in my ſleepe, as if I were againe diſputing with the contradicting Scribe, in great heauineſſe, and that I was ſo put to ſilence, that I could not ſtirre my tongue, to deliuer that truth, which I neuertheleſſe well vnderſtood in my ſelfe. Which perplexity troubled me very ſore, as is very vſuall in dreames (for I make not relation of any higher then a dreame, for ſo much as concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth my ſelfe: howbeit it was no ſmall thing which I learned out of the ſame dreame, God bee praiſed; whom onely to honour, I make this manifeſt to the world,) with this there comes vnexpectedly, (who hee was I ſay not; for I tell a dreame) who put into my mind, and ſaid: thou ſluggard, wherefore doeſt thou not anſwere him by that which is written in the ſecond booke of <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 12. Chapter? for
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:25112:48"/>
it is the Lords Paſſeouer. So ſoone as that appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on came before mee, I awaked, and ſprang out of the bed, and turned to the ſpecified ſentence firſt in the Greeke Bible: and after that I made relation thereof in the beſt order I poſſibly could, to the whole congregation. Which Oration of mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing gladly and willingly heard by them, (as ſhall be by and by declared) all they that were ſtudious in the holy Scripture, and were before brought to doubt by the mentioning of parables, were now by this fully freed of all doubtings. And they celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon the ſame three daies, one after the other, (namely, on holy-thurſday, good friday, and Eaſter day,) the Supper of Chriſt in ſuch multitudes, the the like thereunto I neuer beheld in all the daies of my life.</p>

But hee ſaith onely, that one came before him, who put in his mind, which can alſo well haue been a man. For it befals often, that in dreames by night, the cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this or that man comes before ones ſight: as <hi>Ananias</hi> came in the ſight of <hi>Paul,</hi> Act. 9.12. more
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:25112:48"/>
then that, <hi>Zwinglius</hi> doth not ſay, that he learned his opinion of the holy Supper, (namely, that the word, <hi>This is my body,</hi> is in effect as much as, this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokeneth my body,) firſt of all in a dreame: (which alſo he could not ſay; it ſo being, that hee had pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely preached the ſame oftentimes, and had twice maintained it before the Councell.) But onely this ſaith, <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> that a befitting or example then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly he could finde, was made knowne vnto him in this dreame, to make his opinion to bee beleeued the better. And ſo there are three falſhoods in this Calumnie. The firſt is, that <hi>Zwinglius</hi> learned his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Communion firſt in a dreame. The ſecond is, that a ſpirit did reueale ſuch a doctrine vnto him. The third is, that he confeſſeth he knew not whether it were a good or wicked ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The colour the defamers haue for it, is this; for that <hi>Zwinglius</hi> ſaith of the ſame that hee ſee in his dreame, in Latine: <hi>Ater an albus fuerit nihil memini:</hi> this conſtrue they ſo vpon him, as if hee had ſaid, whether it was a blacke or white ſpirit, know not I. But firſt of all, <hi>Zwinglius</hi> maketh no mention of any ſuch matter, that it ſhould bee a ſpirit, as is formerly mentioned. Secondly, the words alſo, <hi>white and blacke</hi> affoord it not. Yea indeed the words affoord the cleane contrary. For not of ſpirits, but of men, whom one either knowes not, or will not know or nominate, is it vſuall to ſay in this manner in Latine: <hi>Albus an ater fit, neſcio:</hi> and it hath no other man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of conſtruction, then when a man ſaith, <hi>I know not who he is.</hi> As the truth may bee ſeene to the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous

Euen in the like manner would hee not alſo ſpecifie, whom he was that appeared to him in his dreame, that none ſhould taxe him of deſire of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, if hee ſhould haue ſpoken too exquiſitely of this reuelation: but hee eſteemed it ſufficient to giue God the honour therof, praiſing him, and thanking him, before whole Chriſtendome for that he gaue him ſo profitable an information. That and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe was the meaning of <hi>Zwinglius.</hi> And the Defamers know it aſſuredly. For it is not to bee thought, that they ſhould know ſo much Latine, and not know and vnderſtand the nature of this <hi>Prouerbe, Ater an albus fuerit:</hi> and yet for all that, as yet they make no conſcience at all to ſay the cleane contrary. But let them looke well vnto it, that they deale not too rudely with God the Lord. For aſſuredly he will not ſuffer himſelfe to be ieſted withall. <hi>Zwinglius</hi> did neuer boaſt that any new thing was reuealed vnto him in a dreame: but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this did he giue God the glory of, that he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him in a dreame of a ſentence in the Bible, which elſe he could not call to mind. Which ſaying
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:25112:49"/>
is written, Exod. 12.12. where God ſaith of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter Lambe, and of the whole feaſt, which ſhould be held thereupon, <hi>It is the Lords Paſſeouer:</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after hee expounds it himſelfe euen in this manner: <hi>That it ſhould be a token and remembrance of the Paſſeouer.</hi> Exod. 12.13.14. And Exod. 13.9. This ſaying ſaith <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> did God informe him of in a dreame. Whereas now his Calumniators doe ſay, that it is a diuels doctrine which <hi>Zwinglius</hi> learnt in his dreame; what doe they otherwiſe, then raile vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the word of God, as if it were a diuels doctrine? God be mercifull to them and vs all. But verily ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, it appeares to be much like, as if they did herein commit the ſinne, whereof Chriſt ſpeaketh, Matth. 12. which ſhall neuer bee forgiuen, neither in this world, nor in the world to come.

               <p>Behold Reader; euen this was the agreement betwixt Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> and <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> at Marpurge together. And it abides alſo at this day, euen the ſame agreement betwixt Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> and vs.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed that there are more points con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trauerted at preſent betwixt the diſciples of Doctor
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:25112:52"/>
                  <hi>Luther</hi> and vs. But nothing at al with Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe. Which wee doe not ſpeake therefore, that our intent is to helpe and protect our ſelues with the name of Doctor <hi>Luther.</hi> Bleſſed bee God, wee haue a greater help and protection for our grounds, namely, the vnuanquiſhable word of God.</p>
               <p>And whereas wee doe yet notifie the witneſſe of Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> alſo; that is done by vs for this end, that thereby the eyes of thoſe might bee opened, who haue hitherto been blinded with his name.</p>
               <p>The firſt then of the remaining points, which at this day are forced to the liſts, is the point of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt. About which indeed many great and fearefull errours are meaſured out vnto vs by our accuſers. But we are able to ſpeake it for a truth vnto the Reader, that wee did neuer beleeue and teach, and alſo now doe not otherwiſe beleeue and teach in our Churches, about the perſon of Chriſt, then as happy Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> at all times did beleeue and teach thereof: excepting the vbiquitie of the body of Chriſt. Which alſo at laſt Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe renounced and ſaid: <hi>Touching the vbiquity, or being of Chriſts body in all places, it ſhall not bee diſputed of: there is much other matter herein.</hi> Tom. 8. fol. 340. B In all other doctrines about the perſon of Chriſt we doe fully conſent with Doctor <hi>Luther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed our accuſers doe alleage, that wee teach otherwiſe about the vnion of the properties of both the natures in Chriſt,<note place="margin">What we are condemned in, about the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Chriſt.</note> then as happie Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> did teach thereof. For inſtance, they do ſay, that we teach, <hi>that the diuine and humane natures in Chriſt,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:25112:53"/>
haue no actuall and working fellowſhip one with another, and that accordingly, the man Chriſt is not God in very deed and truth, but onely in bare name and title.</hi> Alſo, <hi>that not in very deed and truth the Sonne of God, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a meere man ſuffered for vs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the Reader may take aſſured knowledge, that ſuch blaſphemous thoughts againſt God, neuer en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into our minds. But we haue alwaies, through the grace of God both beleeued and taught the cleane contrary. And wee euen now alſo beleeue and teach the ſame: <hi>That the godly and humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt haue the moſt inward and neareſt fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip one with the other; being both vnited together into one perſon. And that there accordingly Chriſt is very man, not only in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>re name and title, but alſo in deed and truth.</hi> Alſo, <hi>that not a meere man, but the true Sonne of God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Chap.</hi> 2.</note> 
                  <hi>died for vs vpon the Croſſe.</hi> That is our faith here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as is to be ſeene aboue and in all our other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions.</p>
               <p>And our accuſers know it aſſuredly. And yet are they not afraid of God, but publiſh otherwiſe of vs. They take this for their helpe, for that Doctor <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> did in ſome meaſure caſt in the teeth of <hi>Zwing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> that he ſhould haue learned concerning the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the properties of both the natures in Chriſt, alſo of the Godhead of Chriſt, and of the ſufferings and death of Chriſt, not truly, but on the blaſphemous manner aboue named. But the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhall vnderſtand, that Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> himſelfe did it not, but onely Doctor <hi>Luthers</hi> anger did doe it, which ought in all reaſon to be buried with him.
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:25112:53"/>
For God knowes it, and euery man may alſo know it, who will but reade the writings of <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> that Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> as well in this as in many other things, offered violence and iniurie, to the good ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man. And admit that he did vſe ſome ſuch rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which ſeeme to ſauour of the often named er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, in his firſt writings: yet did hee in his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing writings oftentimes ſo free himſelfe both plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and iudiciouſly, that in conſcience al euill ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him ſhould vaniſh away.</p>
               <p>But admit this alſo, that <hi>Zwinglius</hi> had not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently cleared him ſelfe: yet haue others of our teachers, ſince the death of <hi>Zwinglius,</hi> cleared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues many hundred times: and wee cleare our ſelues herewithall once more, adding to full mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: that we doe not beleeue and teach otherwiſe, neither euer did otherwiſe beleeue and teach in our Churches, of the fellowſhip or Communion of the properties of both natures in Chriſt, (in Latine, <hi>De communicatione idiomatum</hi>) then as Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> of happie memorie did beleeue and teach thereof.</p>
               <p>The Summe whereof is to this effect:<note place="margin">The ſumme of the doctrine of Doctor Martin Luther of the fellowſhip of the properties.</note> 
                  <hi>That the Communion of both natures in Chriſt, are common to the alone and vnſeparable perſons of Chriſt. That is, that of Chriſt may be ſaid and vttered both the properties of the diuine, and alſo the humane natures, whileſt both the ſaid natures are in him:</hi> Or which is all one; <hi>that all may be ſaid of Chriſt, what may be ſaid of God, and what may be ſaid of a man: whileſt he is both God and man. But yet muſt ſuch a ſpeech be vnderſtood with difference, as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this maner: When any diuine thing is ſpoken of him,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:25112:54"/>
then muſt it be vnderſtood of the diuine nature. But when as any humane thing is ſpoken of him, then muſt it be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of the the humane nature. For example: It may bee ſaid indeed and in truth of Chriſt; that hee is from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting: and alſo, that he was borne at the appointed time: but not both according to both natures, but the former af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the diuine, the other according to the humane nature. And it is of ſmall conſequence, with what name the perſon of Chriſt is named.</hi> For example, <hi>Whether he be called God or man, the Sonne of God or of man, &amp;c. then is it all to one effect. For it is alwaies vnderſtood of the perſon, which is together God and man. Therefore as it may well and truly be ſaid; Christ is from euerlaſting: euen ſo may it alſo be well and truly ſaid: the Sonne of man is from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting.</hi> Alſo, <hi>as it may well and truly bee ſaid, Christ was borne of the Virgin Mary, and died for vs vpon the Croſſe: euen ſo may it alſo be well and truly ſaid, the Son of God was borne of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and died for vs vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Croſſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the doctrine of Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> of the fellowſhip of the properties of both the natures in Chriſt. <hi>That namely,</hi> (as is ſaid) <hi>the properties of both natures in Chriſt, are common to the alone vnſeparable perſon of Christ; but not to the natures themſelues. And that this fellowſhip is mutuall, that is, that they are as well transferred from the humane nature to the diuine, as from the diuine to the humane. For example, that it may as well be ſaid, the Sonne of God died for vs, as it may bee ſaid, the man Christ is Almighty. And as in deed and truth the Son of God died for vs, though hee did not die according to the Godhead: euen ſo in deed and in truth is
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:25112:54"/>
the Sonne of man Almighty, though hee bee not almighty according to the manhood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againſt this our accuſers doe teach,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vbiquities</hi> doctrine of the fellowſhip of the Properties.</note> 
                  <hi>that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of both the natures in Chriſt, are not common to the alone and vnſeparable perſon of Chriſt; but alſo to the natures themſelues, and that for all that ſuch a fellowſhip is not mutuall: that is, that ſuch a fellowſhip is not tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred as well from the manhood to the Godhead, as from the Godhead to the humane; but that onely ſome proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Godhead are common to the manhood nature. Therefore a man may well ſay; the manhood of Chriſt is almighty, all-knowing euery where preſent, &amp;c. whileſt it is vnited to the almighty, all knowing, and euery where preſent Godhead, perſonally: but on the contrary it may not be ſaid, the Godhead of Chriſt is created, viſible, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable, and diable, whilest it is vnited to the created, viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, palpable, and to the deiected diable manhood, perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally.</hi> This is at this day the doctrine of the Vbiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. And they ſay that Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> of happie memory, did euen ſo beleeue and teach. But ſetting aſide the vbiquity of the body of Chriſt, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme the Reader amiſſe.</p>
               <p>And we are well aſſured, that Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> did neuer teach ſo in all his life of the fellowſhip of the properties, as the <hi>Vbiquitists</hi> do teach therof: <hi>name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                  <hi>that ſuch fellowſhip is performed in the natures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues.<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> And that the ſame for all that is not transferred to and fro, but onely from the Godly to the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> This did Doctor <hi>Luuher,</hi> as is ſaid, neuer teach in all his life. But ſo often as he ſpake of the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the properties of both the natures in Chriſt,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:25112:55"/>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> then did he ſay, <hi>That ſuch a fellowſhip is performed in the perſon of Chriſt, without hurt to the difference of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures:</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <hi>and that the ſame paſſeth to and fro, that is, that all humane properties may be ſpoken of the Sonne of God, as alſo all diuine properties of the Son of man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This hath beene indeed, and at all times the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Doctor <hi>Luther,</hi> of the fellowſhip of the properties of both natures in Chriſt. The which, that the peace-louing Reader may be throughly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of, we will ſet downe word by word, in this place, all the paſſages (as they befell from yeere to yeere one after another) wherein Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> did teach of the fellowſhip of the properties of both the natures in Chriſt, and that as wel out of his ſtrife writings, as out of his doctrinall writings.</p>

               </p>
               <p>That wee now returne againe to Chriſt, it is to bee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued conſtantly, that Chriſt is true God and true man. And ſometimes the Scripture ſpeaketh, and himſelfe after the Diuine nature, and ſometimes after the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As where he ſaith, <hi>Ioh. 8.</hi> Before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, I am. That was ſpoken of the Godhead. But where he ſaith,

                     <p>
                        <hi>Note.</hi> The manhood of Chriſt is not all-knowing.</p>
                  </note> That was ſpoken of the humanity, euen as he could not helpe himſelfe vpon the Croſſe. Howſoeuer ſome will heere ſo ſhew their cunnings, with their darke expoſitions, that they ioyne with heretiks. Alſo is this ſpoken of the man Chriſt, where hee ſaith, <hi>Mark. 13.</hi> Of that day and houre knoweth no man, no not the Angels which are in heauen, neither the Son himſelfe, ſaue the Father. The <hi>Gloſſe</hi> is not heere needfull,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Note.</hi> They that ſay, that Chriſt is alſo almighty according to the manhood, they mingle the two natures one with the other.</note> the Son knoweth not, that is, hee will not know it. What auaileth ſuch a <hi>Gloſſe?</hi> The manhood of Chriſt hath euen like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another holy naturall man, not alwaies thought all things, ſpoken, willed, as ſome <hi>make of him an almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man:</hi> mingling the two natures and their operations one in the other, ignorantly, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The ſecond place is, in the great Confeſſion which he writ,</hi> Anno, <hi>1528. Tom. 3. Ien. fol. 455 B. where he ſaith thus:</hi> All words, workes, ſufferings, and whatſoeuer Christ doth; that doth, worketh, ſpeaketh, and ſuffereth the true Sonne of God. And it is truly ſpoken, the Sonne of God died for vs, &amp;c. If now heere the ſhee wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maker, womens wit, the <hi>allaeoſis</hi> grandmother ſhall ſay, indeed the Diety can neither ſuffer nor die: th u ſhalt anſwere, that is true. But for all that, whilest the Diety and humanity in Chriſt is one perſon, therefore yeelds the Scripture for ſuch perſonall vnions ſake alſo to the Deity<note n="a" place="margin">Namely in <hi>concreto,</hi> as he preſently ſhewes himſelfe.</note>, all that belongeth to the humanity, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe<note n="b" place="margin">

And is in truth ſo alſo. For this muſt thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe: the perſon, (meaning Chriſt) ſuffereth, dieth. Now the perſon is true God. Therefore it is truly ſpoken, Gods Sonne ſuffered. For although indeed that one part, (that I

And yet are they both vnited in the perſon, that it is one Chriſt; and it may be ſaid of him, the man is God, and the man is the ſame that created all things. Euen like as a meere naturall mans body and ſoule are two differing natures, and yet they make one perſon or one man, and each natures worke and office, is ſpoken of the whole man. For ſo ſpeake we of euery other man. The man eateth and drinketh, digeſteth, ſleepeth, goeth, ſtandeth, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, &amp;c. which hee yet doth none of all in ſoule, but onely in body: and yet it may be ſaid of the whole perſon, which conſiſteth of body and ſoule. For hee is a man, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the body, but in reſpect of body and ſoule. Againe it is ſaid of him, the man thinketh, deuiſeth, teacheth. For according to the reaſon of the ſoule, he may be a teacher or maſter, Iudge, Counceller, Ruler, none of which the body according to the members thereof beſtoweth vpon him, and yet for all that a man ſaith, that hee is a wittie head, iudicious, learned, wiſe, and well ſpoken, cunning. And the like is ſaid of a wife, the mother beares, conceiues, or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles the child, and yet ſhe is not called a mother according to the ſoule, but onely according to the body: for all that it is aſcribed to the whole perſon of the wife. Alſo, when one ſtrikes a man on the head, it is ſaid, this man hath ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Iohn,</hi> or <hi>Margaret.</hi> Euen ſo when a member is hurt

Therofore ought we to relie vpon the word and Scripture, and ſo hold the article, and confeſſe that this Chriſt is true God, by whom all things were created and ſuſtained: and againe, the ſame Chriſt the Sonne of God, was borne of the Virgin, and died vpon the Croſſe, &amp;c. Alſo, the mother <hi>Mary</hi> conceiues, beares, ſuckles and nouriſhes, not onely the man, or fleſh and blood: for that were to ſeparate the perſon; but ſhee conceiues and nouriſhes a Sonne, who is Gods Sonne; therefore is ſhe truly called, not only the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of man, but alſo of God. As the old fathers alſo taught the ſame against the Neſtorians, who would make a way through, that <hi>Mary</hi> ſhould not bee called the mother of God, and would not ſay, that ſhee had borne the Sonne of God.

For I will not haue ſuch a one of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Worſhip.</note> in whom I ſhall beleeue, and call vpon as my Sauiour, who is a bare man; elſe ſhall I ſhal to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.

For if hee could perſwade mee, that I ſhould behold Chriſt as a bare man crucified and dead for me, then were I vtterly loſt. But and if I repoſe my whole treaſure hereon, that Chriſt both true God and man, died for me, &amp;c. that waieth vp and driueth away all ſinne, death, hell, and all woe and ſorrow of heart.

For God and man is one perſon: What the man heere doth, ſuffereth, and ſpeaketh, that doth, ſuffereth, and ſpeaketh God: and what God doth and ſpeaketh, that doth and ſpeaketh the man, which is the onely Sonne of God and <hi>Mary,</hi> in one vnſeparable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and two differing natures.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Out of all theſe places it is manifeſt, that Doctor</hi> Luther <hi>did neuer teach in all his life any ſuch</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municationem idiomatum, <hi>as is preſently taught:</hi> Namely, that onely the Diuine properties ſhould bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the humane nature, and yet not all, but onely ſome of them: but the humane properties ſhould not bee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to the Diuine nature. <hi>Alſo,</hi> whatſoeuer is ſaid by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of ſuch communion of the whole perſon of Christ, the ſame may alſo bee ſaid of either nature. <hi>For example,</hi> whilest it may be ſaid by vertue of the communion of the properties: the man Chriſt is almighty: therefore may it alſo be ſaid; the manhood of Chriſt is almighty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>This doe we ſay, did Doctor</hi> Luther <hi>neuer teach in all his life, but this is alwaies the ſame that hee
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:25112:65"/>
taught,</hi> de communicatione idiomatum: that the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both natures are common to the one alone and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable perſon of Christ; and that according to the ſame both Diuine and humane properties may bee ſaid of the one alone and vnſeparable perſon of Christ: but yet with this prouiſo, that the Diuine properties ſhall bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of him, according to the Diuine, and the humane properties according to the humane nature.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it is not much materiall, though ſome of his words ſound ſo, as if both the natures properties ſhould be common to either nature. As where hee ſaith,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jn Chap <hi>14.</hi> Iohn.</note> 
                  <hi>as before is mentioned:</hi> All that the Scripture ſpeaketh of Christ, that ſpeaketh it ſo, that it takes hold on the whole perſon, euen as were both God and man one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and often ſo changeth the words, that of either na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture both is ſpoken, for the perſonall vnions ſake. <hi>Which is called</hi> Communicationem idiomatum <hi>Theſe words ſeeme well ſo to ſound, as if the properties of both natures ſhould bee common, not onely to the whole perſon of Chriſt, but alſo to either nature in the ſame perſon. But Doctor</hi> Luther <hi>in very truth, had no ſuch meaning. But this is his meaning,</hi> That of the perſon of Christ named after either nature, both the natures properties may bee ſaid, <hi>That is,</hi> that of Christ both the natures properties may be ſaid, be it either ſpoken of the Diuine or of the humane nature. Euen as preſently after he expounded himſelf, where he ſaith: that it may be ſaid, that the man Christ is the euerlaſting Sonne of God, by whom all creatures were made, and is Lord of heauen and earth, &amp;c. So alſo againe, Christ the Sonne of God, (that is, the perſon which is true God) was conceiued and
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:25112:65"/>
borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> ſuffered vnder <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> was crucified, and died, &amp;c. <hi>Out of which his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, it is apparant, that he in the former ſpeech where he ſaid, that of either nature both kinds may bee ſaid, did vſe the names of the nature for the names of the perſon;</hi> abstract for the concret, <hi>as the Logicians ſay, which thing alſo he very often vſed to doe: as he confeſſeth himſelfe, where hee ſaith:</hi> So ſpeaketh the Scripture more acutely of Christ then we,<note place="margin">In the Poſtill vpon the Epiſt. vpon Chriſts day fol <hi>101.</hi> B. Edit. Wit. Anno, <hi>1540.</hi>
                  </note> and wreatheth the perſon ſo finely in the nature, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth the nature againe, that there are few who do truly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, and I my ſelfe haue erred in this and the like ſpeech, that I haue appropriated to the nature, that which appertaineth to the perſon, and contrariwiſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore when one will iudge truly of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; then muſt he not pick out onely ſome ſingle words out of his writings, (as hitherto ſome haue done) but he muſt haue due regard vnto his whole expoſition.

               <p>
                  <hi>Therefore that is in no ſort the doctrine of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> Luther, <hi>which is vrged at this day vnder Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor</hi> Luthers <hi>name:</hi> Whereas it is alleaged, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of both natures in Chriſt, are not onely common to the alone and vnſeparable perſon of Chriſt, but alſo to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures amongſt themſelues: and ſuch communion doth not

                  </note> and for it ſelfe, but in conſideration, and by vertue of the perſonall vnion: <hi>that helpeth not the matter at all: But if it bee that any where a creature hath the diuine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties vpon it, let it haue the ſame from whence it will, and in what manner it will, then is the ground falſe, that all that hath godly properties vpon it, is God.

Of the ſame we haue heretofore diuers times ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared our minds, that the contentious are forced to confeſſe themſelues, that there is nothing rebuke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the ſame. Onely ſay they, that wee haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foretime ſpoken and written of that matter, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then now we doe ſpeake and write thereof.</p>
               <p>Admit now that it were ſo indeed, ought wee therfore to be railed vpon, for that we make amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:25112:67"/>
But for all that, they giue wrong informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alſo thereof. For (God bee bleſſed and praiſed) the doctrine of the foreknowledge, or almighty go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of God ouer all creatures, hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſo true in our Churches and ſo cleare, that we neuer haue had any need to amend the ſame. The Reader may pleaſe to looke ouer all the Catechiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes and confeſſions of our Churches, which hee can euer come by. And hee ſhall finde no other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine therein of the foreknowledge of God, then the ſame which we doe at preſent maintaine in our Sermons and writings.</p>
               <p>This is the cauſe then, why the contentious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leage that wee teach otherwiſe of the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God, then wee haue done formerly: for that now (God be praiſed, and thanked) many Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Princes and Lords, haue themſelues heard and read what wee teach, as well of this as other points. And demand of the contentious, wherefore they talke of ſo many terrible things, which wee ſhould teach about the foreknowledge of God, whereas they cannot yet finde the leaſt ſhew there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in our Sermons and writings. When now they be ſo caught in vntruth, and cannot eſcape: then do they ſeeke this ſtarting hole and ſay: yea, it is true, in the preſent Sermons and writings of the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, are not ſuch terrible errours to be found. But if their former writings bee ſeene into: there may the ſame be found in abundant meaſure.</p>
               <p>This is the originall cauſe of this calumnie, as if we did teach otherwiſe at preſent of the foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

of God, then we haue taught in former times.</p>
               <p>But what, they accuſe vs to haue formerly taught ſo offenſiuely, of the foreknowledge of God, and now to bee ſilent in, in ſumme is thus much: <hi>That God had not onely ſeene from euerlaſting, all that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to paſſe, whether it bee good or bad, that it would come to paſſe: but alſo decreed, that it ſhould come to paſſe, for cauſe of a good end, to which hee would vſe the ſame.</hi> Or, which is all one; <hi>that nothing is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed without the euerlaſting councell and will of God, whether it be good or bad, and that the ſame euerlaſting councell and will of God is vnchangeable. And that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame al muſt ſo come to paſſe, as it commeth to paſſe.</hi> Alſo, <hi>that the permiſsion of God, when he permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth that which is euill, is not a bare permiſsion, but that God hath alwaies his hand in the worke, and hee turneth and ordereth euery action, to what hee hath ordained it in his euerlaſting councell.</hi>

Alſo, <hi>Let the Diatribe plot, thinke, imagine, ſing, ſay, what they will: yet hath God decreed from euerlaſting, that</hi> Iudas <hi>muſt bee a trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, then muſt he commit treaſon; and it is not in</hi> Iudas, <hi>or in the power of any creature, to haue it any otherwiſe, or to change his will.</hi> fol.524.

For Gods will is powerfull, and will not be hindred. For hee is nothing elſe then the godly force and power it ſelfe. And alſo God is the moſt wiſe, ſo that no man can deceiue him.

A. Alſo, <hi>this do we alſo ſay, that when God worketh all in all things, he alſo worketh in the vngodly, it ſo being that he created all things alone, and ruleth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and moueth and driueth them according to his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty powerfull working, which no creature can ſhunne or change, but it muſt follow, euery thing according to his owne kind giuen it of God. Then are they</hi> copartners of God in workes, <hi>all vngodly, &amp;c.</hi> fol. 548. Alſo, <hi>all people vpon the earth finde theſe two principles printed and written in their hearts, that they muſt acknowledge in their hearts, and ſay yea thereunto, (howſoeuer not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly) when they heare them mentioned. For the firſt,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:25112:69"/>
that God is almighty, not onely in reſpect of force, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in reſpect of powerfull operation, &amp;c. For the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that he knoweth all things, and hath decreed from euerlaſting, and can neither erre nor faile. When yea is ſaid in the hearts of all men, to theſe two principles, then it followes by and by moſt powerfully, and certainely, that no man can gainſay, that wee were not, neither are made by our owne willes: but it muſt euen ſo come to paſſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the will of God. And it followes alſo, that we do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing what we wil, according to free will but what, when, and how God hath decreed it from euerlaſting, and</hi> wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: <hi>according to his councell, and euerlaſting power, which can neither faile or change.</hi> fol 528.</p>
               <p>Such and many more the like ſayings are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten here and there in the writings of Doct. <hi>Luther</hi> which do affirme as much as we doe; <hi>That all muſt ſo come to paſſe, as God hath decreed, ordained, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined from euerlaſting; and that his almighty working concurreth in all things.</hi> Therefore either we do no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It may bee both are true, might ſome man ſay that namely, Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> as well as you, did err in this point? Anſwere: they may faile that will yet cannot God faile; who hath ſpoken euen ſo in his holy word of this matter, as both we and Doct. <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeake thereof: that namely, there commeth nothing to paſſe, without the councell and will of God, whether it be good or bad.</p>
               <p>For example: was not that a wicked act, that <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi>
                  <pb n="115" facs="tcp:25112:69"/>
betrayed Chriſt? yet for all that Chriſt ſaith, that it was ſo determined by God. <hi>Behold,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the hand of him that betrayeth me, is with me at the table, and truly the Sonne of man goeth, as it is appointed.</hi> Luk. 22.21.22. And to the like effect, <hi>as it is written of him.</hi> Math. 26.24.</p>
               <p>[Note. <hi>As it is appointed, and as it is written of him, is taken in the holy Scriptures for all one. By which it is manifeſt, that al that ſtands written in the Scriptures, that ſhould come to paſſe in time to come, was ſo appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God, that it ſhould come to paſſe, and that theſe ſayings: the Scripture muſt be fulfilled, and the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of God muſt ſtand, are all one.</hi>]</p>
               <p>And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith: whileſt it was ſo appointed or ſo written, it muſt therefore bee accompliſhed. <hi>The Scripture muſt haue been fulfilled, which the holy Ghoſt by the mouth of Dauid, ſpake before of Iudas.</hi> Act. 1.16.</p>
               <p>Yea not onely the treaſon of <hi>Iudas,</hi> but alſo of all the wicked deeds and murtherous acts, which <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> and <hi>Pilate</hi> with the heathen and people of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el committed againſt the Sonne of God, ſaith the Scripture: <hi>They did whatſoeuer the hand and councell of God had determined before to be done.</hi> Act. 4.28. And addeth further thereunto, that accordingly it <hi>must</hi> ſo come to paſſe. <hi>It must bee ſo ſaith Christ himſelfe.</hi> Matth. 26.54.</p>
               <p>Alſo, it was ſo written (or determined. For that is all one, as was preſently before ſhewed) <hi>And thus it behoued Chriſt to ſuffer.</hi> Luk. 24.46.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:25112:70"/>Yea the Scripture throughout aſcribeth this whole worke to God the Lord himſelfe, and ſaith; <hi>The Lord would breake him, and make him ſubiect to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities,</hi> Eſa. 53.10. Alſo, <hi>I will ſmite the ſhepheard.</hi> Zach. 13.7.</p>
               <p>So was the worke principally the worke of God, But <hi>Iudas, Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> with the heathen, and the people of Iſrael were but <hi>inſtruments</hi> and tooles, which God vſed to accompliſh ſuch a worke.</p>

               <p>An other example. Whereas Satan prouoked
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:25112:70"/>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> to number the people, and <hi>Dauid</hi> did it. 1. Chron. 21.1. that was a great ſinne; as well of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as of <hi>Dauid.</hi> Neuertheleſſe the Scripture ſaith not barely and alone, that God did permit it: but it ſaith alſo, that God did it himſelfe; as appeareth by the plaine text: <hi>And the wrath of the Lord was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine kindled againſt Iſrael, and he moued Dauid againſt them, in that hee ſaid, goe, number Iſrael and Iudah,</hi> 2. Sam. 24.1.</p>
               <p>An other example. Was not that a fearefull great ſinne? that the vnnaturall ſon <hi>Abſolon</hi> hoiſted his aged and decaying father from his kingly ſeate, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his fathers ten concubines in the ſight of all Iſrael? yet ſaith God to <hi>Dauid;</hi> not onely I will permit it: but alſo I will doe it. <hi>I will take thy wiues before thine eyes, and giue them vnto thy neighbour, and he ſhall lie with thy wiues in the ſight of this Sunne. For thou diddeſt it ſecretly: but I will doe this thing before all Iſrael.</hi> 2. Sam. 12.11.12.</p>
               <p>Theſe and the like examples, whereof there are great ſtore in the Bible, doe manifeſtly witneſſe, that the permiſſion of God, when hee permitteth that which is euill, is not a bare and naked permiſſion: but that he hath alſo a hand in the worke, and hee gouernes and turnes it after his owne pleaſure. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe hee could not ſay, I will doe it: or I haue done it.</p>
               <p>It is very hotly caſt in our teeth, that one of ours ſhould haue written, that God doth ſomthing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoke a man holily to ſinne. But with as great dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is that left out, that without doubt ſtands by
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:25112:71"/>
it (or wee miſtake the matter) that God doth ſo no otherwiſe, then when he will puniſh ſinne with ſin, which vndoubtedly is a holy worke: as the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius are forced to confeſſe, where they ſay, <hi>So is blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding aſcribed to God the Lord, as a puniſhment of ſinnes formerly committed, which in it ſelfe is a good worke of godly iuſtice.</hi> Heilb. Synopſ. fol. 50. And what cauſe haue they to complaine much againſt vs? the holy Ghoſt himſelfe vſeth the like ſpeech, where hee ſaith in the lately mentioned example of <hi>Dauid. And the wrath of the Lord was againe kindled againſt Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and he</hi> moued <hi>Dauid againſt them, in that hee ſaid, goe, number Iſrael.</hi> 2. Sam. 24.1.</p>
               <p>But yet they are hard ſayings, might ſome man ſay, and they ſeeme in truth to import as much, as if God were thereby made the cauſer of ſin, and had a delight in ſin. For how is it poſſible that he ſhould not bee the cauſer of ſinne, and haue a delight and pleaſure in ſinne, when that hee hath not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined the ſame, that it ſhould be accompliſhed; but alſo hath himſelfe a hand in the worke, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth mankind thereunto?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> Blind, mad, and peremptory reaſon thinkes ſo indeed. But whoſoeuer ſubmitteth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to the word of God, with an humble hart, he ſhall wel know &amp; learn to vnderſtand, that therfore God is no cauſer of ſinne, or hath delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in ſinne, though indeed he haue ordained, that this or that ſinfull worke of his creature ſhould come to paſſe, and the worke muſt be done, yea hee aſcribeth it to himſelfe. The which the better to be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:25112:71"/>
vnderſtood, by the Godfearing Reader, we will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part this information in ſhort, according to our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers for his aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The Almighty God, as he once created al things, euen ſo gouerneth hee all things continually by his prouidence. Therefore the prouidence of God is nothing elſe, then the almighty gouernment of God ouer all creatures good and bad: and contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth two parts in it. The firſt part is, that hee main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the being and power of all creatures, ſo far and in what manner it pleaſeth him: without which maintenance no creature can be ſuſtained a minute of one houre: or is able to rule or moue himſelfe in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The ſecond part is, that he hath the motions of all creatures in his hands, and turneth them which way he wil: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the worke which he will accompliſh by them: as <hi>Dauid</hi> ſaith, <hi>They continue all by thine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> Pſal. 119.91. and the examples manifeſt, that ſometimes fire, ſometimes water: ſomtimes good, ſomtimes bad Angels: ſometimes godly, ſomtimes wicked men: ſometimes frogs, ſometimes lice, &amp;c. muſt ſerue to accompliſh his councels. And there is nothing exempt from ſuch a diſpoſing of God: e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen alſo that which ſeemeth to be already perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: as it is written: <hi>The lot is caſt into the lap, but the whole diſpoſition thereof is of the Lord.</hi> Prou 16.33. No not yet the very hearts and thoughts of men, as it is written: <hi>The Lord looketh downe from heauen, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:25112:72"/>
beholdeth all the children of men. From the habitation of his dwelling he beholdeth all them that dwel on the earth. He faſhioneth their hearts euery one,</hi> Pſal 33.13.14.15. Alſo, <hi>The heart of the King is in the hand of the Lord, he turneth it whither ſoeuer it pleaſeth him,</hi> Prou. 21.1.</p>
               <p>It is true God hath indued the Angels and men with that kind &amp; nature, that they can moue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues by their owne free will, and either intend this or that. Euen indeed as they doe. But for all that hee holdeth the raines of their free will in his hand, in ſuch a manner, that either hee can let them proceed, when it goeth after his will; or he can pull it backe, or moue it to this or the other ſide, euen as ſometimes a man draweth on a beaſt to a ſnare, which hee letteth either paſſe freely before him, or pulleth backe, or can turne hither or thither. Which compariſon God himſelfe vſeth, where hee ſaith to the King of Aſſiria; <hi>I will put my hooke in thy noſtrels, and my bridle in thy lips, and will bring thee backe againe the ſame way thou cameſt.</hi> Eſa. 37.29.</p>
               <p>So both Angels and men remaine all of them together vnder the power and gouerment of God; and cannot forecaſt, much leſſe bring to paſſe, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther little or great, without the will of God.</p>
               <p>Yet for all that there is a great difference, in that which they intend to doe. For ſometimes they doe that which God hath commanded them to doe: ſometimes they do the cleane contrary, out of their free will. When they now do that which God hath giuen them commiſſion for, then doe they right therein, and God is well pleaſed therewith, further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:25112:72"/>
it, and rewardeth it at the laſt. But when they doe what hee hath forbidden them, then doe they badly therein. And though hee ſuffer them ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to goe on in ſuch their doings, yet hath hee no pleaſure in their diſobedience, but hateth the ſame diſobedience earneſtly, and puniſheth them at laſt. But hee therefore ſuffereth them to proceed in ſuch their wicked actions, that he may vſe the ſame to good; and alſo knoweth how to turne them ſo, in their wicked courſe by the bridle of his proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that they cannot aſſault any where in their wickedneſſe, but where he will. For which there is a notable example of <hi>Shemei:</hi> hee was of himſelfe the enemy of <hi>Dauid:</hi> and God vſeth him to this end, that he ſhould poure out his enmity vpon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> euen at the ſame time, when God would cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and humble <hi>Dauid</hi> by him. Which <hi>Dauid</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed truly, where hee ſaith: <hi>Suffer him to curſe; for the Lord hath bidden him curſe Dauid. Who dare then ſay, wherefore haſt thou done ſo?</hi> 2. Sam. 16.10. God did not bid him by any outward command: but hee bid him by a ſecret and vnſearchable manner, whereby he moued the wicked band-dog, that hee ſhould euen fall vpon <hi>Dauid</hi> and bite him. Euen as hee by his ſecret and vnſearchable order, comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the rauens, that they ſhould feed <hi>Elias,</hi> 1. King. 17.4. And the Whale-fiſh, that hee ſhould caſt out <hi>Ionas</hi> vpon the dry land, <hi>Ionas</hi> 2.10.</p>
               <p>According to theſe, ſo it is true that God doth not that which is euill, but permitteth or ſuffereth it to be done. Therefore in all equitie there can bee
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:25112:73"/>
no guilt of ſinne laid vpon him. But the guilt onely of ſin is the free wicked will of the ſinfull creatures. But for all that the permiſſion or ſufferance of God muſt ſo be right vnderſtood; namely not thus, that God doth onely barely looke on, what is done by the creatures: like vnto one who ſtanding on a high tower, beholding how the knaues runne about and tumble together in the market ſtead: but careth not for it, how they agree together, neither hauing it in his power to alter it. No: It hath no ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in it. But the permiſſion or ſufferance of God is ſo to bee vnderſtood, that indeed hee lets the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked creatures run a little after their owne free wils: but yet he holdeth the raines alwaies in his hand, as before is ſpecified: whereby hee can ſoone turne them, now this way, now that, or elſe wholly hold them backe, according to his owne pleaſure: and hee guideth them ſo with his raines, that euery one muſt performe the ſame, which he hath determined to haue effected by them.</p>
               <p>From whence it may well bee ſaid, that the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>miſſion of God is not a bare permiſſion, but tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> parts of the foreknowledge of God together. Firſt that he ſuſtaineth the being and power of the crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ture, euen in the committing of ſinne; as is well knowne. For the ſecond, that he hath alſo their wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and ſinfull motions in his hands, and ſo turneth them, that the ſame muſt be effected thereby, which he will haue effected, to the furtherance of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:25112:73"/>
and the benefit of his ſeruants. Therefore he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſcribeth the worke, which is effected in this maner, oftentimes to himſelfe: as the aboue named examples doe witneſſe.</p>
               <p>Moreouer, whatſoeuer God now effecteth or permitteth in one or other, and in what manner hee turneth and accompliſheth the one or the other: euen ſo hath hee foreknowne to doe from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, and determined in himſelfe; as it is written: <hi>From the beginning of the world God knoweth all his workes.</hi> Act. 15.18. Alſo, <hi>Hee worketh all things accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the councell of his owne will.</hi> Epheſ. 111. Which councell and will of his, moſt certaine cannot bee hindred or kept backe by any creature: but it muſt vnfaileably come to paſſe whatſoeuer he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined: as it is written: <hi>The Lord of hoſts hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined it, who ſhall diſanull it? and his hand is ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and who ſhall turne it away?</hi> Eſa. 14.27. Yet for all that, the wicked creatures doe performe their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill actions, which they doe, without any prouoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therto, but out of free wil. For not euery muſt, taketh away free will, <hi>Christ muſt ſuffer,</hi> Luk. 24.26.46. <hi>And yet it was his good will,</hi> Pſalm. 40.8. <hi>The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen must containe Christ,</hi> Act. 3.21. <hi>And yet he was not forced to it, but did it gladly,</hi> Ioh. 17.13.24. <hi>So, Iudas must betray Christ; and yet hee was not inforced to it, to betray him, neither ſecretly, nor openly, but hee did doe it gladly, and out if freewill: therefore he is alſo rightly pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed euerlastingly for it.</hi> And euen the ſame is one part of the ſpeciall vnſpeakeable wiſdome of God; that he can ſo manage his gouernment, that he alſo
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:25112:74"/>
with thoſe creatures, which yet doe what they do, out of free will, and in reſpect of their natures could doe otherwiſe, yet for all that can vnfallibly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the ſame, which hee hath determined to haue accompliſhed by them.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith thus of this matter: <hi>If not we our ſelues, but God worketh in vs our ſaluation, then can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not we act any thing holily, before ſuch time as his is there, doe we, frame we, and worke we it the beſt wee can. And I ſay, we must doe wickedly, not that we are inforced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto; but as we vſe to ſay, it must bee ſo of neceſsity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſistance; and yet not by any powerfull compulſion and force. That is, when a man hath not the ſpirit of God, then is he not as it were driuen headlong by force, that he muſt commit wickedneſſe againſt his will (as they vſe to carrie a theefe or murtherer to the gallowes againſt his will) but he doth it willingly and gladly, &amp;c. That is here by vs called a Muſt, or muſt bee of neceſsity, which is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ſubiect to alteration, &amp;c.</hi> Tom. 6. Wit. Germ. fol. 479 480. Alſo, <hi>We know well that</hi> Iudas <hi>betrayed Chriſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully. But we ſay; that ſuch a will in</hi> Iudas <hi>was certainely and vnchangeably to bee accompliſhed, at the time and houre as God had determined it. Or, if we bee not yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, then muſt wee make a difference of two neceſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. One neceſsity, where I am forced to a worke by force. The other, where a thing muſt come to paſſe at a certaine time without conſtraint, &amp;c He that now heares vs ſpeak, let him know, that we ſpeake of the laſt, and not of the firſt. That is we doe not ſpeake of this, whether</hi> Iudas <hi>was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly a traitor, or againſt his will: but whether it muſt come to paſſe at the time and houre, which God had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:25112:74"/>
vnchangeably, that he ſhould betray Chriſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly.</hi> fol. 529. a.</p>
               <p>This is the conſtruction of vs, and Doct. <hi>Luther,</hi> how theſe ſayings are to bee vnderſtood: that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing commeth to paſſe, vnleſſe God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it that it ſhould come to paſſe, whether it bee good or euill, and that it muſt ſo come to paſſe, euen as the Lord hath determined it: and that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of God is not a bare and empty permiſſion, but that alwaies there is mingled ſomething of his working. Out of which expoſition, wee hope the God-fearing Reader hath vnderſtood ſo much: that by ſuch ſpeeches God is not made the cauſer of ſinne; but onely that the honour is giuen vnto him, that hee is the Almighty Lord of heauen and earth: without whoſe will no creature can moue and ſtirre it ſelfe: and that he alſo ſuffereth no crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture otherwiſe to moue and ſtirre, then as hee will turne and vſe their motions to a good end, though it be otherwiſe euilly intended by the creature. As it is ſpoken very plainly, and finely made difference of, about the mad knaues, who ſold their brother <hi>Ioſeph</hi> into Egypt: <hi>Ye thought euill againſt me, but God diſpoſed it to good, that he might bring to paſſe, as it is this day, and ſaue much people aliue,</hi> Gen. 50.20.</p>
               <p>What is eſpecially meant by that word <hi>Prouoke:</hi> it is clearely expounded in the holy Scripture: that God for his part prouoketh no man to wickedneſſe; but Satan, and the euill luſts of men doe it. Iam. 1.13.14. 1. Ioh. 3.8. But whileſt God vſeth this meanes thereto, when he will puniſh ſinne with ſinne, that
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:25112:75"/>
hee deliuereth men vp vnto Satan or their owne luſts; therefore the worke which theſe inſtruments accompliſh, is not only aſcribed to the inſtruments, but ſomewhat alſo to God himſelfe. As the often mentioned examples of <hi>Dauid</hi> doe witneſſe: of which it is written in one place, that the diuell ſtood vp, and prouoked <hi>Dauid</hi> to number Iſrael, 1. Chron. 21.1. And in another place it ſtandeth, The Lord moued him therunto. 2. Sam. 24.1. namely, through the ſeruice of Satan. For all things are ſeruants to him. Pſalm. 119.91. And there are more examples to bee found in the Scriptures, which doe ſay, that God doth oftentimes vſe the diuell, and other wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked creatures in his ſeruice. As <hi>Iob</hi> 1. Alſo, 1. King. 22. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And wee take it this is ſpoken ſufficiently of this matter, to manifeſt our innocency.</p>
               <p>Now will wee alſo heare how our contradictors will haue it, how men ſhould ſpeake of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God. They would haue that men ſhould ſay, that indeed God did ſee from euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting the euill aforehand, that it would come to paſſe: but he did not determine that it ſhould come to paſſe. As alſo it is not his will now that men ſhould doe wickedly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwere.</hi> It is moſt certainly not the will of God, that men ſhould commit euill. And ſo farre forth in very deed hath hee not determined, that any euill ſhould come to paſſe, as if namely hee tooke a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the ſame euill. But in reſpect that he through this or that euill worke of his creature, will accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:25112:75"/>
this or that good worke, or will performe pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, then can no man denie that he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that the ſame euill deed ſhould be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med through his permiſſion: except they will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie and controll the Lord Chriſt himelfe, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſaid, that it was determined that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould betray him. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.22.</p>
               <p>Alſo, except they will gaineſay all the Apoſtles ioyntly, who ſpeake moſt clearely, that <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> with the Gentiles and people of Iſrael, did doe no otherwiſe, then the hand and councell of God determined before to bee done. Act. 4.28. In ſumme, God will in ſome reſpect doe a thing, and alſo will not in ſome other regards and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. God will haue it that <hi>Iudas</hi> ſhould be faithfull and true to Chriſt, in reſpect that it is right and good of it ſelfe ſo to bee. But in conſideration, that through the vnfaithfulneſſe and treaſon of <hi>Iudas,</hi> our redemption might be procured: therefore will he haue it, that the ſame treaſon ſhall proceed: and in conſideration heereof, hath hee alſo determined from euerlaſting that it ſhould proceed. For as hee will haue a thing at preſent, euen ſo and no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe hath he willed and determined euerlaſtingly, according to the often aforementioned ſaying, knowne vnto God are all his workes, <hi>from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world,</hi> Act. 15.18. And the holy Scripture goeth yet further, and ſaith, that God doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vſe euery creature to what purpoſe he will, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo that he created them: but alſo that hee hath ſtirred vp and created euery creature for this cauſe,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:25112:76"/>
that hee would vſe them to this or that end: as wee reade of King <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that God ſaith plainely to him: <hi>And in very deed, for this cauſe haue I raiſed thee vp, for to ſhew in thee my power, and that my name may be declared throughout all nations.</hi> Exod. 9.16. Which is indeed a very hard ſaying to reaſon, and the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked haue alwaies murmured againſt it, and ſaid: <hi>Why doth he yet find fault? for who hath reſisted his wil?</hi> Rom. 9.19. But the ſpirit of God ſtands to it, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemeth the wicked not worthie of any other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, then this: <hi>Nay but O man, who art thou that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliest againſt God? ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? hath not the Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter power ouer the clay, of the ſame lumpe, to make one veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell vnto honour, and another to diſhonour?</hi> Rom. 9.20.21. With which anſwere the godly being humbled, caſt downe themſelues and ſay, <hi>Lord thou art righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all thy waies, and holy in all thy workes.</hi> Pſal. 145.17. <hi>Though wee poore men vnderſtand not, how thou ru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lest.</hi> Pſal. 147.5.</p>
               <p>The contradictors alſo find fault with this word <hi>Determined,</hi> and ſay it is not truely ſpoken, when it is ſaid, God hath determined all things to a good end, whatſoeuer comes to paſſe, whether it be good or euill. Now not onely the holy Scripture vſeth this phraſe in this matter. As where the Apoſtles doe ioyntly ſay: <hi>Herod and Pilate, with the Gentiles, and people of Iſrael did doe to Chriſt, whatſoeuer the hand and councell of God had before determined to be done,</hi> &amp;c. Act. 4.28. (for ſo did Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> interpret the Greeke word <hi>Proheriſe,</hi> which <hi>Paul</hi> vſeth in this

Alſo, where <hi>Sirach</hi> ſaith: <hi>Death and bloodſhead, ſtrife and ſword, calamities, famine, tribulation and ſcourge: theſe things are created for the wicked,</hi> Chap. 40.9.10. But alſo Doctor <hi>Luther</hi> vſeth the very ſame word, euen to the ſame purpoſe as we doe, where he ſaith, <hi>It is indeed ſo, that no man can doe good or hurt, as the Scripture ſaith, except hee bee ordained thereunto of God.</hi> Tom. 2.

               <p>But we haue iuſt cauſe of wondering, how they will reconcile that which they ſay in the Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dion booke: <hi>The foreknowledge of God ordereth the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, and ſets it his bounds.</hi> fol. 250. Alſo, <hi>What the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt wicked will of Satan and men intend, act, and deſire, that is ſeene and knowne of God aforehand; and his</hi> Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, <hi>that is, foreknowledge, keepeth his</hi> Order, <hi>euen in the wicked fact or working, that God ſetteth his marke and meaſure to the euill which hee liketh not, how farre it ſhall goe, and how long it ſhall endure: when and how hee will hinder and puniſh the ſame, all which yet the Lord God ſo</hi> gouerneth, <hi>that it muſt redound to the honour of his Diuine Maiesty, and the benefit of his choſen ſeruants, and the wicked ſhall come to confuſion by the ſame.</hi> fol. 319. And yet they alleage, that it is Caluiniſh, when it is ſaid, that God hath appointed alſo the euill that comes to paſſe, to euery thing his proper end?</p>
               <p>They ſay in the Concordion booke: <hi>But the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and cauſe of euill, is not the foreknowledge of God, (for God prouides and workes not euill, neither hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:25112:77"/>
and furthers the ſame) but Satan, and the corrupt will of man.</hi> fol. 319. Anſwere. Euen the very ſame alſo is our opinion. For wee ſay not, that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge of God is the beginning and cauſe of ſinne: but that the alone working cauſe of euill, in as much as it is euill, is the diuels and mens corrupt will. Onely ſay we, that God turneth it to good, by his vnſearchable wiſedome and power, the euill which he lets come to paſſe, and hath ordained the the ſame to ſuch a good vſe, by his foreknowledge. And this confeſſe our contradictors alſo. Wherfore is the diſcord then? for nothing elſe, as it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, then for the fooles cap. Except our contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors be of this meaning, that God did not certainly conclude any thing from euerlaſting, of all things, which his creatures purpoſed in time to come, out of their owne free wils, whether ſuch things ſhould come to paſſe or not, and vnto what end hee would turne and vſe them: but that hee onely did behold from euerlaſting, and now continually beholdet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> what euery man doth: and that hee doth euery day bethinke himſelfe a new, what hee will doe therein, as the neceſſity of his honour and our ſaluation ſhal require. Euen as a generall doth, who cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mine all things at one time, what hee will doe after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; but muſt daily conſult according as occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is adminiſtred. If our contradictors be of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, then doe wee roundly confeſſe, that wee are not of their opinion. For we do not beleeue in ſuch an vnmighty God, who might order and change his councels according to the willes and purpoſes
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:25112:77"/>
of his creatures: But we doe beleeue in ſuch an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, after whoſe councell and will, all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures muſt bee ordered, whether they doe it gladly or not, wittingly or ignorantly. This is our faith: and we truſt, no man that doth know God, ſhall lay any blame vnto vs for the ſame.</p>
               <p>Alſo, vnto this is commonly drawne the <hi>diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> about the fall of our firſt parents: and it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether ſuch a f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll were before from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting ordained by God and determined, that it ſhould come to paſſe or no; and whether accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it muſt ſo come to paſſe? Now it were much better, that wee on both ſides troubled our ſelues how wee might bee raiſed againe from this heauie fall, then that wee ſhould much diſpute how wee came into the ſame. But yet for all that, to the end that nothing be kept in ſilence by vs: we doe plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſe, that wee doe not beleeue that God did create man at a venturous haphazard: but wee are thus perſwaded, that God, firſt and before hee crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted man, did conſider all things well, not only how he would create them, but alſo how hee would go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them, and what hee would make, or in what manner hee would vſe them to his honour. For if God alſo careth ſo for the ſparrowes, whereof two are ſold for a farthing, that not one of them ſhall fall to the ground without his will. Mat. 10.29. How much more hath hee then ſo cared for mankind, which hee created after his owne image, from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, that nothing could befall vnto him, without his will. And wee reade expreſly alſo in the holy
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:25112:78"/>
Scripture, that God hath from euerlaſting decreed with himſelfe the <hi>diſpoſition</hi> or order,<note place="margin">1. Pet. 1.20. Mat. 20.16. Epheſ. 1.3.4.5, 6.7.8.9.10.11.12. Rom. 9.21.22.23.</note> how he would deale with the fallen poſterity of mankind. Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he would giue them his Sonne to be a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, and would conuert many of them to him, and ſhew his mercy and grace to them, but vnto the other his iuſt anger againſt ſinne. How can we then doubt, that hee alſo did purpoſe and determine in himſelfe from euerlaſting to permit the fall: yea that hee created the ſame humane race, euen for that <hi>diſpoſition</hi> and order ſake, which he would hold in the gouernment of mans poſterity? for it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that God ſhould not attaine vnto the end, which hee purpoſed in himſelfe in the creating of man, or elſe he muſt not be an almighty God. Then is there now no need to prie and ſearch into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret councell of God, what hee decreed from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting therin, about the creation and gouernment of the poſterity of mankind. The iſſue thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrateth it plainely enough: were we now but ſo humble, that wee would ſuffer our ſelues to bee tutored by God, and deſired not to tutor him.</p>
               <p>But whereas ſome will conclude hence, that if the fall of mankind were ordained of God from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting, then could it not poſſibly faile, but hee muſt bee a cauſer thereof: that doth not follow at all. Euen as little as God is the cauſe that <hi>Iudas</hi> did betray Chriſt, though indeed he determined, that it ſhould come to paſſe. Luk. 22.22. The cauſe why it followes not is this: for that God did not deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that he would himſelfe found and worke the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:25112:78"/>
fall of mankind; but onely, that hee would permit the diuell to bee founder of it, and man to ſet it a worke, as it alſo came to paſſe. The diuell hath foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the fall; our firſt parents haue ſet it a worke: all out of free will. Therefore is not the guilt to bee aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to God the Lord, but onely to themſelues. Which yet is ſuch a wiſe and almighty God, who could eſtabliſh from euerlaſting, his owne vnfallible councels, euen alſo of the ſame, which his creatures would doe out of free will.</p>

For euery man can by the power of nature, heare and meditate in the word of God.

                  <note place="margin">Note. Meerely out of will.</note> fol. 513. B. Alſo, <hi>I know well what it is that the reaſon of man is highly offended withall; namely, that God out of will, and meerely out of will, forſaketh and hardeneth a man, euen as hee had a pleaſure in the euerlaſting deſtruction of him.</hi> fol. 527. B. Alſo, <hi>Then you heare very well, that reaſon thinkes it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſeeming, that God ſhould damne thoſe, who cannot will that which is good, neither can ſhun the deſert of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore it muſt be falſe which</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, Hee hath mercy on who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he wil, and who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he will he hardeneth, ſo muſt now our Lord God deiect himſelf out of his chaire and a common fellow ſit therein, and ſo ſuffer himſelfe to be preſcribed lawes and ordinances, to damne no man but as we by the iudgement of reaſon thinke, that hee hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued the ſame.</hi> fol. 534. A. <hi>But if God ſo worketh, that he hath reſpect to deſert, wherefore do they then murmure ſo much, and contend with God? Wherefore doe they ſay, why doth hee yet complaine? who hath reſiſted his will? and what cauſe had</hi> Paul <hi>to ſtill them? for they would not make much wondring, much leſſe complaine ſo hotly,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:25112:82"/>
when as they knew that they had deſerued it.</hi> Alſo, <hi>Where remaines then, that the potter had power to make what he would, one veſſell for honour, the other to diſhonour: if he bee ſubiect to lawes and ſeruices, and dare not effect what he will, but it ſhall be propounded to him what hee ſhould doe? For theſe two are directly oppoſite the one to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that deſert ſhould be reſpected, and that alſo he ſhould haue the power and liberty to doe what pleaſeth him. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as the houſe-father in the Goſpell ſufficiently testifieth, dealing with the murmuring workemen, layeth before them his power and liberty, and ſaith: Is it not lawful for me to doe as I will with mine owne, &amp;c? But I will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, that God the Lord muſt be ſuch a one, that hee hath reſpect to deſert in thoſe whom he damneth: So muſt wee euen as well yeeld and ſay, that God hath reſpect to deſert in thoſe, whom he ſaueth. For and if we will follow the iudgement of reaſon, then is it euen as vnlike and vntrue, that he ſaueth thoſe who doe not deſerue it, as that he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes thoſe, who haue not deſerued the ſame<note n="a" place="margin">Namely, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the opinion of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: it ſo being that it is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to ſhun ſin.</note>. So muſt we (I perceiue) alſo conclude, that hee ſhould make men out of foregoing deſerts; or they will ſay, that he is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuſt God, who hath a delight and pleaſure in wicked men, and therewithall that hee maketh ſinners, drawing them from ſinne and vngodly courſes, by his grace and reward. But wee vnto vs miſerable men, if we had ſuch a God, who then ſhould bee ſaued? Whereby thou ſeeſt how deepe and ſecret wickedneſſe is hidden in the heart of man, that God ſhould make the ſinner bleſſed without deſert, and take the ſinner, who hath deſerued otherwiſe to mercy: to this doth not reaſon ſay, that hee is an vnrighteous God, for this it complaineth not, neither murmureth againſt God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:25112:83"/>
yet it is vnright, if it ſhould be meaſured euen according to reaſon. But wherefore doth it not complaine for it? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is a thing that is ſweet and ſeruiceable to it. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſeemes true, and most acceptable. But when God doth condemne thoſe who haue not deſerued the ſame, or hath ordained ſome to deſtruction before euer they were borne: whilest this is a bitter and ſower doctrine vnto them, and ſauoureth not their pallates, therfore complaine they that it is vniuſt, and vnſupportable, there they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, murmure and blaſpheme. Wherefore thou ſeeſt, that the Diatribe do not cenſure there, according to likelihoods and truthes, but according to their owne minds and harts delights. For and if they doe throughly and truly conſider that, then do they euen as well contend with God, when he ſaueth ſinners, and thoſe that deſerued it not, as they doe contend with him, when hee damneth thoſe who haue not deſerued the ſame. Alſo they will euen as well praiſe God and thanke him, when he condemneth thoſe that deſerued it not, as they glorifie him, when hee receiueth ſinners to mercy, and ſaueth them who did not merit the ſame. For it ſeemeth alike vnright on both ſides, if the reaſon of man ſhould bee the iudge herein. For it is euen alike vniuſt, when a man ſhould praiſe</hi> Cain <hi>for the murther he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and extoll him as a King before God, as when a man ſhould impriſon and ſtrangle innocent</hi> Abell. <hi>If ſo be now that reaſon commendeth God, when hee receiueth the ſinner to mercy, and yet blameth God, when hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneth thoſe that did not deſerue it, then ſhall catch them heere manifeſtly, and can vanquiſh them in this, that they doe not ſoundly and barely praiſe God, as their God, but cenſure according to their owne profits, ſeeking
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:25112:83"/>
and praiſing themſelues, and their owne things in God, not ſeeking God barely and his honour. But louing reaſon is it pleaſing to thee, when God accepteth and ſaueth ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; then ſhould it not diſpleaſe thee alſo when hee dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth whom he will. Is hee iuſt in that, then is hee alſo iuſt herein. In that doth hee ſhead out grace and bounty vpon vs being vnworthie; in this he vſeth ſeuere fierceneſſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and ſharpeneſſe, againſt them that did not deſerue the ſame. But according to the cenſure of men, hee doth too much to them on both ſides, and hee is ſo an vnrighteous God, but yet he is a iuſt and faithfull God in himſelfe. For how that is right, that he ſaueth the ſinner, and thoſe that deſerued it not, is at preſent not able to be conceiued of vs, but we ſhal know it, when we attaine to the manſion, where faith ſhall be compleate, and we ſhall ſee face to face. Euen ſo alſo, how that is right, that hee condemneth thoſe who haue not deſerued the ſame, is alſo at preſent not conceiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able: but we beleeue it, vntill the time that the Son of man ſhall bee reuealed from heauen.</hi> fol. 534. B. Alſo, <hi>That the euerlaſting will of the Diuine Maieſty letteth ſome paſſe, caſteth them off, and condemneth them: wee neede not enquire wherefore God doth it, but it beſeemeth rather that we worſhip God with feare &amp; trembling, who is able to effect ſo high and waighty workes, and will doe it.</hi> fol. 510.

For wee muſt ſquare our ſelues after the rule of his word: and not after his vnſearchable will. For who can rule himſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the will of God, which is wholly hidden, and is not to be knowne? It is enough for vs to know that there is an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable will in God: but what it is that this will effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth, how, whether, how farre it goeth, that is not beſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming vs once to enquire after, to ſearch into, or to know, but onely to reuerence in all feare and trembling.</hi> fol. 508 A.

                  <hi>wherefore God ſuffered</hi> Adam <hi>to fall? and wherefore did he let vs al be ſinners in him, and be borne in a nature cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, if he could haue ſuſtained him ſufficiently? Or, wherfore did he not first reſanctifie the nature, renue and cleanſe the ſame, before ſuch time as all other men were borne out of the ſame? or did not make vs otherwiſe? To which in ſhort this anſwere is ſufficient, He is God: to the will of whom, can no law ground, or cauſe to bee yeelded.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:25112:85"/>
For it ſo being that there is nothing in heauen or earth to paraliſe him; alſo nothing that ſurmounts him; there can be no rule, number or meaſure appointed him, but his will is the meaſure, or rule to all creatures. For if ſo be that his will hath a meaſure or rule, law, ground and cauſe then were it indeed not Gods will at all. For that which he will, is not therefore right, becauſe hee ſhould or muſt ſo will it; but the cleane contrary; that which hee will is therefore right, becauſe he will ſo haue it. The creature hath lawes and ordinances, grounds and cauſes appointed to it: but the will of the Creator hath none: will wee then ordaine another God, and another Creator of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</hi> fol. 524. A. Alſo, <hi>But wee ſay now euen as wee haue done formerly, that the ſecret will of Gods Maiesty ſhall not be enquired into, but onely ſhunne ſelfe-conceited reaſon, which alwaies forſaketh Chriſt, faith, loue, and the Croſſe, and wil mount aboue the clouds, before her feathers be growne. We are not here to be troubled in ſearching in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the high great ſecrets of Gods Maieſty, which dwelleth in right that none can attaine vnto, as</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith.</hi> 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. <hi>We must keepe our ſelues cloſe to God, wherein he accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth of vs, who became man, euen in Ieſus Christ the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, as</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, in whom is hidden the fulneſſe of the wiſedome of God. For in him haue we richly both what is knowne vnto vs, and that which wee ought not to know.</hi> fol 510. A Alſo, <hi>But reaſon will heere ſay, euen like the cuſtome of the mockers, being both noſe wiſe and ſelfe min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. Yea indeed this is a fine found thing, that when as you are forced with ſtrong grounds and arguments, that then you flie to the will of Gods Maiesty; there muſt the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpartie hold his peace: euen as the</hi> Aſtrologie <hi>with
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:25112:85"/>
their</hi> Epicyclis, <hi>turne all questions from the courſe of the heauens. To which this my anſwere: It is not a thing found by mee, whereas I ſay the will of God is not to bee ſearched into, but it is founded in the word of God, and there commanded. For ſo ſaith</hi> Paul <hi>to the Romans, chap.</hi> 9. <hi>Thou wilt ſay then vnto me, why doth he yet complain? for who hath reſiſted his will? But O man, who art thou which pleadest against God? ſhall the thing formed, ſay to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? hath not the potter power of the clay, to make of the ſame lumpe, &amp;c. And</hi> Eſay <hi>ſpake thereof before</hi> Paul, <hi>in his</hi> 58. <hi>Chapter. They ſeeke me daily, and will know my waies, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as a nation that did righteouſly, and had not forſaken the ſtatutes of their God, they aske of me the ordinances of iuſtice, and will draw neare vnto God. As I take it theſe words giue ſufficient testimony, that man ſhall not ſearch into the will of the Maiesty. And it ſo being, that this caſe of freewill and euerlaſting Predestination, is of ſuch ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall conſequence, where the corrupt reaſon and fleſhly man are accuſtomed to ſearch after the will of the Maieſty; it is therefore of ſpeciall neceſsity that wee ſay vnto them, that they herein keepe ſilence, and yeeld the honour that belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to the Diuine will and Maieſty. In other matters which are handled, wherein cauſe may be giuen, and cauſe muſt be taken vpon command, therein are not men ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent in ſearching. But and if yet there bee ſome who will be ſearching after the will, and will not giue regard to our admonition; thoſe doe we let paſſe, euermore to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate with God, as the giants doe: and they ſhall ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit or praiſe they ſhall purchaſe by it.</hi> fol. 510.

For whilest that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, death and ſinne is our Lord, and the diuell our God and Prince, there can bee no power nor ſtrength, no wit nor vnderstanding, whereby wee can frame or further our ſelues to righteouſneſſe and life, but we must remaine blind and fettered ſlaues of ſinne and Satan, doing and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending whatſoeuer ſhall be pleaſing to him, and ſo ſhall be contrary to God and his Commandements.

doctrine is a terrible and blaſphemous hereſie. <hi>fol.</hi> 251. B. And it notifieth alſo the right ground, wherefore God ſaw and found no cauſe in vs, why he ſhould elect vs: namely therefore; <hi>Becauſe ſaith it, before ſuch time as a man is enlightened, changed, new borne, renewed, and drawne by the holy Ghoſt, hee can ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as much of himſelfe, and by his owne naturall power in Diuine matters, change himſelfe, or begin to regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate himſelfe, worke or partake in working, euen as much as a ſtone, blocke or hedge. For though hee bee able to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the outward members, and to heare and ponder the Goſpell in ſome meaſure, and alſo ſpeake thereof, as is to be ſeene in the hypocriſie of the Phareſies: yet doth he eſteeme for follie, and will not beleeue it.

               <p>Behold Reader; ſo teacheth the Concordien booke of this matter. And ſo it ſets <hi>in effectu</hi> euen as well as we, an <hi>an abſolute decree,</hi> that is, a free meere councell of God; whereby hee hath elected ſome whom hee would enlighten to beleeue in Chriſt.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:25112:87"/>
And ſaith, God did not find any cauſe of ſuch his councell in vs.<note place="margin">Of reprobation.</note> Onely for ſo much as concerneth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, therin is it not a meere ſet councell: but there is in him a manifeſt and well knowne cauſe of reprobation; namely ſin: which wee alſo yeeld the true conſtruction vnto. For God condemneth no man but for ſinne; and therfore hath he not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained any man to damnation, but in reſpect of ſin. And in that reſpect the councell of reprobation is indeed not a meere free councell. But when it ſhall be demanded, that whileſt all men are ſinners, and that no man hath ability aboue others, to furniſh and frame himſelfe to Gods gratious election: wherefore then doth God paſſe by theſe in the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and not others.

And the Concordien booke doth euen confeſſe the very ſame alſo; for it teacheth expreſly (as was preſently ſhewed) that no man hath power before others, to furniſh and frame himſelfe to Gods gratious election. And therefore we accord in this point, and that wholly with the Concordien booke: except it be ſo that it diſcordeth with it ſelfe. Which contrariety to be in it, will neuer bee yeelded vnto by Doctor <hi>Daniel Hofman,</hi> who was a famous Lutheran, and a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ſubſcriber of the Concordien booke: but hee ſaith, this is the conſtant and proper doctrine of the Concordien book, that God did not find any cauſe of election in vs: and that Doctor <hi>Hunnius</hi> and <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> who doe ſay, that God did foreſee from euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting, who they were that would fit and prepare

are you in my hand. In the first birth did wee not fall ſo well out, therfore he caſteth vs againe in the earth through death, and he maketh vs againe at the youngeſt day, that ſo we may fall out well, and be without ſinne.</p>
               <p>He beginneth theſe councels in Baptiſme: which beto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the death and reſurrection at the youngest day.

               <p>So is man wholly pure and innocent Sacramentally: that is not otherwiſe meant, then that he hath the token of God, Baptiſme, whereby is teſtified his ſinnes ſhould all die, and he ſhould die in grace, and riſe againe at the youngeſt day, pure, without ſinne, innocent, to liue euerlaſtingly.

               <p>Therefore when a man commeth to yeeres, then begin the naturall ſinfull luſts to ſhew themſelues, as pride, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, incontinency, hatred, couetouſneſſe, and the like.

                  <note place="margin">True vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note>Then thou wilt ſay, what auaileth it me then to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, when it destroyeth not, and putteth ſinne away
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:25112:92"/>
wholly and altogether? Heere followes now the true vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the Sacrament of Baptiſme. Thus auailes the bleſſed Sacrament of Baptiſme, that God therein him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe couenanteth with thee, and maketh a gratious and comfortable league with thee.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, thou yeeldest thy ſelfe to the Sacrament of baptiſme, and to the ſignification thereof. That is, that thou deſirest to die to ſinne, and to bee made new at the youngest day &amp;c. that doth God accept at thy hands, and lets thee be baptized, and he beginneth preſently to create thee anew: Inſpiring thee with his grace and holy ſpirit, which beginneth to mortifie nature and ſinne, and prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth thee to die, and to riſe againe at the last day.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond, thou alſo contracteſt to do the ſame, and to crucifie thy ſinne more and more, all thy life long, euen to thy very death. Which is acceptable to God alſo, and hee exerciſeth thee as long as thou liuest with good workes, and manifold ſufferings, wherby he acteth the ſame which thou diddest deſire in thy baptiſme: that is, that thou wilt be free from ſinne, and wilt die, and wilt riſe againe at the youngeſt day, and ſo fulfill baptiſme. Therefore doe we reade and ſee how he ſuffered his beloued Martyrs and Saints to be ſo martyred, that they being but ſlaine, fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Sacrament, died and were created anew. For if ſo bee that that commeth not to paſſe, and wee haue neither ſufferings nor exerciſes, then will the corrupt nature of man ſo preuaile, that hee will make baptiſme vnprofitable vnto him; and ſo hee falleth by ſinne, and ſo remaines an old man, as he was before. Whileſt now ſuch thy couenant is vnuiolated, God giues thee grace againe, and bindeth himſelfe to thee, that hee will not impute thy ſinnes vnto
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:25112:93"/>
thee, which are in thy nature after baptiſme, hee will not looke vpon them, neither damne thee for them, hee ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth himſelfe therein, taking pleaſure that thou art conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in exerciſe and deſirest to kill the ſame, and to bee freed from them by death. Therfore though euill thoughts or deſires doe indeed ſtirre, yea though thou alſo ſomtimes ſinnest and fallest, yet if thou ariſe and returneſt againe into the couenant, ſo are they thus eſteemed by vertue of the Sacrament and couenant, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom. 8.</hi> Such is the nature of this Sauiour, that hee damneth not thy naturall ſinfull motions, who beleeueſt in Christ, and doest not cheriſh the ſame, neither conſenteſt thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>If ſo be now this couenant were not, and that God did not mercifully looke through the fingers, then were there no ſinne ſo ſmall, but it would condemne vs. For the iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of God can endure no ſinne. Therefore there is no greater comfort vpon the earth then baptiſme,<note place="margin">The comfort which we haue of Baptiſme.</note> through which wee enter into the ſentence of grace and mercy, which iudgeth not ſinne, but expels it with many exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,<note place="margin">The true vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and vſe of Baptiſme.</note> &amp;c. In reſpect whereof no man hath cauſe to bee terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, though he feeles euill luſts and deſires, and not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paire, though he ſhould euen fall, but ſhould call his baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me to mind, and refreſh himſelfe hartily with the ſame, that God hath bound himſelfe therein, to mortifie his ſins, and not reckon them to damnation, if hee doe not conſent thereunto, or remaine therein, &amp;c.</p>

                  </note>
                  <hi>Alſo,</hi> heere is now the third part of the Sacrament to bee handled, that is faith; that is, that a man doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly beleeue, how that this Sacrament doth not only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token the death and reſurrection at the youngest day, by
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:25112:93"/>
which a man is made anew,<note place="margin">How that is to be vnderſtood, that the worke of Baptiſme doth preſently begin in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme.</note> to liue euerlaſtingly without ſinne, but that it alſo doth certainly begin and worke the ſame, and vniteth vs vnto God, that wee will euen vnto death, mortifie ſinne, and ſtriue against the ſame, and hee on the contrary ſide will hold vs excuſed, and deale grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly with vs, and not iudge vs according to rigour, for that we are not without ſinne in this life, vntill we be puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by death.<note place="margin">How a man is pure.</note> So now thou vnderſtandeſt how a man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, pure, and without ſin in baptiſme, and yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth full of many euill luſts, ſo that hee cannot otherwiſe be called pure, then for that he hath made entrance there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into, and for that the ſame purity hath a ſigne and coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, that he ought to be more pure. For which cauſe God will not attribute his remaining vncleaneneſſe vnto him, and ſo hee is more pure by Gods gratious account of him, then if that he ſhould be pure in his owne nature, &amp;c. For which cauſe a man must be very bold and free in holding himſelfe to baptiſme, and beare himſelfe againſt all ſinne and terrour of conſcience, and moſt humbly ſay: I know very well, that I haue no cleane thing in mee, but I am yet chriſtened, through which God, who cannot lie, hath bound himſelfe not to impute my ſinnes vnto mee, but to crucifie and to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>So we doe now vnderſtand, that our innocency of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is ſo called wholly and ſolly in reſpect of the Diuine mercy, which begun it, and taketh pitie on ſinne, eſteeming vs as if we were without ſinne, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alſo,</hi> ſinne muſt ſtill be, for in truth wicked motions are to be eſteemed ſinne, but this difference is to bee made, that Gods grace will not yet reckon them for ſinne, if that wee encounter them with many endeauours, workes and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:25112:94"/>
ſufferings, and at the laſt crucifie them by death. Whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer doth not ſo, to thoſe will hee not remit them, becauſe they doe not keepe touch with him in baptiſme, and their couenant, but hinder the begun worke of God in baptiſme, &amp;c. And doe not know that they had power giuen them for their whole liues, euen vnto the time of death, yea and to the youngeſt day, as was ſaid before. <hi>Alſo,</hi> is there any man fallen into ſinne, then let him moſt ſtrongly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber his baptiſme, how God did there ioyne in contract with him, to pardon all his ſinnes, if hee will but reſiſt them to the time of his death. Vpon the ſame truth and couenant of God, a man muſt cheerefully repoſe himſelfe, and then doth baptiſme proceed in his worke and ſtrength againe, and then is the heart againe quieted and refreſhed. Not in reſpect of his worke or ſatisfaction, but in Gods mercy which is promiſed him in baptiſme, for euer to remaine. And a man muſt be ſo ſteadfaſt in faith, that though all creatures and all ſinnes ſhould conſpire againſt him, yet he would not be remoued, in reſpect that whoſoeuer yeelds himſelfe to be beaten from that hold, he maketh God a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar in his contract in the Sacrament of baptiſme, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>So then we ſee, that baptiſme, howſoeuer it be hindred in his worke by ſinne;<note place="margin">Res Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti: Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</note> yet the forgiueneſſe and crucifying of ſinne, is onely made voide, through vnbeleefe of the ſame. And faith recals againe the ſame hinderance of his operation, ſo that it doth wholly conſiſt in faith.</p>
               <p>And that I may ſpeake it plainely, then is it one thing, to pardon ſinne, and an other to put off and renounce ſinne. Faith layeth hold on the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, though they be not wholly expulſed but to expulſe ſinne, is by an endeauour againſt ſinne, and dying at the laſt, ſin ſinkes
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:25112:94"/>
to the bottome. Both of theſe workes appertaine to Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me. So writes the Apoſtle to the Hebrewes, that they who were baptized, and their ſinnes pardoned, they ſhould cast away ſinne, which preſſed downe. For whileſt I do beleeue that God will not attribute my ſinnes vnto mee, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines Baptiſme in force, and my ſinnes are pardoned, though a great part thereof remaine. After that followes the final diſpoſition thereof, through ſufferings and death. This is the article which we confeſſe, I beleeue in the holy Ghoſt, the forgiueneſſe of ſinnes, &amp;c. There conſiſts Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme most eſpecially, in which this forgiueneſſe is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, through Gods contract with vs, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Alſo,</hi> for which cauſe muſt we keepe a good watch, lest a deceiueable ſecurity doe not intrude it ſelfe, whereby wee are moued to ſay with our ſelues, doe ſo great and gracious things conſiſt in Baptiſme, that God will not aſcribe our ſinnes vnto vs, and ſo ſoone as wee returne from ſinning, then is all in good caſe, by vertue of Baptiſme, then will I ſo long as I liue, liue as I liſt, and afterwards, or at the day of my death I will take my Baptiſme to heart, and put God in mind of his couenant, and ſo fulfill the worke of my Baptiſme. Yea aſſuredly, there conſiſts ſo much in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, that when thou returneſt againe from ſinne, and calleſt vpon thy couenant in Baptiſme, then are thy ſinnes pardoned vnto thee. But looke well to it, when thou ſhalt ſinne ſo peruerſly and wilfully vpon grace that iudgement doe not take hold on thee, and come vpon thee before thy returne come, and though thou then wouldeſt beleeue in Baptiſme or truſt therein, that through Gods perm ſsion, thy tentation bee ſo great, that there will bee no place for faith. For if ſo be that they doe ſcarcely remaine, who doe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:25112:95"/>
not ſinne, or indeed doe fall by meere frailty: where ſhall the outragious appeare, who haue tempted and mocked the grace of God? Therfore let vs walke with feare and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, that wee may maintaine the riches of his Diuine Maieſty with a ſteadfaſt faith, and giue praiſe vnto his mercy cheerefully, for euer and euer. Amen.</p>

Alſo it ſhould bee hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den when they come together, and one ought to tarrie for another, 1. Cor. 11.18.33. And therefore do we thinke that it is not conformable to the word of God, when it is adminiſtred to one alone. And therefore alſo doe wee admoniſh our Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, that they participate in the Supper when they are in health, and may receiue it with the publike congregation: The which they alſo do; and are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry well ſatisfied with ſuch an order: Excepting, when at any time one is a bedrid man, and hath ſuch an infirmity vpon him, which will not ſuffer him to come to the publike Communion. In that caſe if any man deſire, that the Supper might bee communicated with him together in the houſe. It is readily accompliſhed; yet with this caution, that the ſicke perſon doe neuer communicate alone, but that the whole company, as a little congregation or houſe Church, doe communicate with him. This doe we hold to be agreeable to the order of Chriſt: and yet preſcribe we nothing to others therein.</p>
               <p>The ſixth fault they finde, is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>6.</hi> Of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſme.</note> for that we doe not vſe the Exorciſme, (that is, coniuring of the diuell) in Baptiſme.

And Doctor <hi>Hunnius,</hi> chiefe Profeſſor of Wittenberge a little before his death, did write very large <hi>theſes, de abrogando Exorciſmo:</hi> which were afterwards printed at Erphord, and from thence came to our hands: wherein he allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth many cauſes wherefore the Exorciſme ſhould alſo be abrogated in the reſt of the Lutherian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches wholly, where yet it was in vſe. As namely, and for the firſt, whileſt Chriſt was not the author thereof, but it is a very meere inuention of man. For the ſecond, whileſt the words <hi>(I coniure thee thou vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane ſpirit, &amp;c.)</hi> let them bee turned and trimmed the beſt that may bee, yet for all that they beare ſhew of no other conſtruction, then as if the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Chriſtians were bodily poſſeſſed of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell.</p>
               <p>For the third, whileſt the gift of diſpoſſeſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other miracles, are ceaſed, &amp; wee know not now any more of any coniurers of the diuell, then of the popiſh Exorciſts and Witches.</p>
               <p>For the fourth, whileſt not onely the common man, but alſo many learned make it a thing of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity: as if without it Baptiſme were not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat.

Which motiues are worthy of deepe conſideration. And at the very leaſt they do demonſtrat thus much: That it is not a Caluiniſh hereſie, whereas many have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brogated the Exorciſme.

               <p>But it is alleaged, that if it ſo fall out that a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher cannot be had ſo ſuddenly, that then the child is ſhortened of ſaluation. But where ſtands that written, that the ſaluation is ſo knit vnto Baptiſme in ſuch a ſort, that all thoſe that depart vnbaptized, muſt therefore be damned and periſh? The ſaying of Chriſt is alleaged: <hi>Except that a man bee borne of water, and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the kingdome of God,</hi> Ioh. 3.5. But firſt of all, this ſaying did not ſpeake of the earthly water in Baptiſme: as if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the ſame no man could bee regenerated and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued.
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:25112:99"/>
For then the theefe who ſuffered with Chriſt on the Croſſe muſt haue alſo been damned. To whom yet Chriſt ſaid, to day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe. But this ſentence ſpeaketh of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly water of the holy Ghoſt. Which water God poureth out vpon vs, when wee doe beleeue in Chriſt. As it is written in, Ezek. 36. and in Ioh. the 7. Chapters. And there is as little materiall cauſe to conclude the neceſſity of the terreſtriall or ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall water of Baptiſme, out of this ſaying: as out of the ſaying in Matth. 3.11. <hi>Hee will Baptiſe you with the holy Ghoſt and with fire:</hi> there may bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded a neceſſity of an tereſtriall or elementall fire to be baptized withall. Beſides and if it were that this ſaying ſpeake of the baptizing with water: yet did it not therefore follow, that all vnbaptized chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren muſt periſh. For there was as vehement words ſpoken of Circumciſion, as could euer bee ſaid of Baptiſme: <hi>The vncircumciſed manchild, in whoſe fleſh the foreskin is not circumciſed, euen that perſon ſhall bee cut off from his people.</hi> Gen. 17.14. And yet it hath not ſuch a conſtruction, as if all vncircumciſed children ſhould periſh: but only it is thus to be vnderſtood, that thoſe children ſhould periſh, who out of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Gods token of his couenants were of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not circumciſed. Euen as God himſelfe addeth the cauſe, where he ſaith: <hi>Becauſe hee hath broken my couenant: that is, hath diſdained it,</hi> Gen. 17.14.

<pb n="176" facs="tcp:25112:100"/>
                  <hi>Dauid</hi> did neuer make doubt of the ſaluation of his child, for all that it died the ſeuenth day of his age, and ſo was as then not circumciſed. 2. Sam. 12.18.23. For he did not ſuffer it to die vncircumciſed out of any contempt of the holy Sacrament: but ſeeing it did die before ſuch time as it ſhould or could be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed according to the inſtitution of God. When now it ſhall ſo come to paſſe with our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, as it befell to <hi>Dauid</hi> with his child: that they die before ſuch time as they can be baptized accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the inſtitution of Chriſt: then doe wee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue euen ſo as <hi>Dauid</hi> did beleeue; namely, that God is a moſt true God, and wil keepe his couenant (where he ſaid: <hi>I will bee thy God, and to thy ſeed after thee.</hi> Geneſ. 17.7.) with vs; though hee doe not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies affix his zeale vpon vs.</p>
               <p>The example of <hi>Zippora, Moſes</hi> wife is alſo obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt vs, who circumciſed hir ſon; and God ceaſed to be angry, whereas elſe he would haue kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 4.24.25. Alſo the example of the Iewiſh women who did ſecretly circumciſe their children, vnder the perſecution of <hi>Antiochus.</hi> 1. Mac. 1.51.63. and 2. Macch. 6.10. But it is yet diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, whether theſe women did right or not? and it cannot bee forced out of it, that God did yet ceaſe his anger, when that <hi>Zippora</hi> circumciſed her ſonne.

did alſo concurre: as that ſhe did doe it her ſelfe vnpatiently: whereas ſhee ought to haue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her husband patiently to haue done the ſame:) he did in mercy beare with the ſame: euen as he alſo did beare with others of his Saints both in the old and new Teſtament in many things out of his meere goodneſſe: not that we ſhould therefore imitate the ſame. And therefore we haue no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by theſe or other the like examples: but if ſo be that one could finde ſuch an example in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bible, that a child was circumciſed before the eighth day, becauſe of the weakeneſſe thereof: that were ſomthing to the purpoſe. But there is no ſuch example to bee found. And the Iewes alſo at this day practiſe no ſuch nead circumciſion. Therefore from hence there cannot bee any nead Baptiſme proued. And if any where in time of need women may baptize; then may they alſo in time of need adminiſter the holy Supper: which hitherto hath neuer been yeelded vnto them by any man.</p>
               <p>The eighth fault which they find in our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>8.</hi> Of Jmages.</note> for that we haue no pictures of God and his Saints in our Churches. But this cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictorie to the word of God. For the hauing of God and his Saints pictures in the Churches; is not onely not commanded of God at any time in his word, as our opponents themſelues confeſſe: but alſo earneſtly forbidden. As may be ſeene clearely in the ſecond Commandement.<note place="margin">Exod. 20. Deut. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt make thee no grauen Image, neither any ſimilitude of things that are in heauen aboue, neither that are in the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:25112:101"/>
nor that are in the waters vnder the earth, then ſhalt not bow downe to them, neither ſerue them, &amp;c.</hi> In which Commandement God hath forbidden two things vncontroleably: firſt, that there ſhal be no ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude made of him in any manner: yea alſo not in the ſhape of a <hi>man,</hi> as he expreſly declareth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, Deut. 4.15.16.17. where hee ſaith: <hi>Take there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore good heed vnto your ſelues, for ye ſaw no Image in the day that the Lord ſpake vnto you in Horeb, out of the middeſt of the fire: that yee corrupt not your ſelues, and make you a grauen Image, or repreſentation of any figure, whether it be the likeneſſe of</hi> man <hi>or woman, or the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of any beaſt that is on the earth, or the likeneſſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny feathered fowle that flyeth in the aire: or the likeneſſe of any thing that creepeth on the earth, or the likeneſſe of any fiſh that is in the waters beneath the earth.</hi> By which text the Wittenbergers were inforced, &amp; acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged many yeeres agone, that in the pictures of God, very eaſily might be ſinned againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God. And therefore the leſſer pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of God, the better action performed therein. <hi>In the needfull anſwere.</hi> fol. 72. And therefore do we paint no manner of pictures, that ſo wee might not put our ſelues in danger of ſinne vnneceſſarily. For that there is no neceſſity of hauing the picture of God, the Wittenbergers themſelues doe willingly yeeld the ſame to vs.</p>
               <p>The ſecond thing which God hath forbidden vs in the command of Images, is, that wee ſhould not bow downe vnto them, nor ſerue them. Out of which vngaineſayably followes, that alſo we ought
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:25112:101"/>
to haue no Images in thoſe places, where there is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhew and danger of bowing before them. For it ſtands written, <hi>Abſtaine from all appearance of euill,</hi> 1. Theſ. 5.22. Alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God:</hi> That is, thou ſhalt not endanger thy ſelfe nor thy neighbour peremptorily: not in hazard of the body, much leſſe in hazard of the ſoule. Deut. 6.16. Matth. 4.7. Now haue all their Images in the places of the worſhip of God: and eſpecially the Images vpon the altars: the ſhew and danger of worſhip in them: as is largely demonſtrated in the three writings: of the <hi>Anholtes Reformation.</hi> Therefore cannot we otherwaies acknowledge them that ſuch Images are forbidden of God. Euen as alſo in the in the Temple of <hi>Salomon,</hi> to which for all that the maintainers of Images fly readily for ſhelter, there was not one onely altar Image, alſo not any one I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God or of his Saints: but there was onely ſuch caruings of knobs and grauings with flowers, which could adminiſter no ſhew and danger of worſhip. The which alſo is not contradicted in our Churches.</p>
               <p>The ninth fault they find in our Ceremonies, is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>9.</hi> Only Deutſch ſeruice of God in Deutſch Churches.</note> for that wee haue caſt out of our Churches the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſongs and collects, and do performe the whole publike worſhip of God in the Deutſch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.2.3.12.16.</note> Now for the ſame wee haue a cleare text in the holy Bible, which ſaith thus: <hi>Hee that ſpeaketh a ſtrange tongue, he ſpeaketh not to the edification of men nor exhortation, nor comfort. Therefore ſeeke that yee may excell vnto the edifying of the Church. Elſe when
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:25112:102"/>

               </p>
               <p>In which text is not only tolerated, but alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, that the publike worſhip of God ſhould bee exerciſed in a knowne language: whereby a poore ſimple man may bee comforted and edified, and when God is prayed vnto and praiſed, he may be able to ſay Amen thereunto. What thinke they then to purchaſe, by taxing this for an errour in vs?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>10</hi> Of Maſſe apparell.</note>The tenth fault which they finde in our Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, is, for that we haue put off the Maſſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and quire veſtments, wherof we will not vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe to ſay more then this, where ſtands it written, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did put on maſſe appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell and quire veſtments, when they did exerciſe the worſhip of God?</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>11.</hi> No Organs.</note>The eleuenth fault they finde, is, for than wee vſe no Organs in our Churches. Whereof the people are not rightly informed. For there are diuers <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> Churches, wherein the Organs are vſed. As indeed they are no where forbidden. Yet common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we doe therefore not vſe them: whileſt we finde more hindrance to proceed thereof then profit, by the worſhip of God: and alſo in this caſe we deſire to remaine by the ſimplicity of the Apoſtolicall Churches, which neither had nor vſed any ſuch things in their congregations. In the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment indeed they had muſicall inſtruments in the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:25112:102"/>
worſhip of God: but it was alwaies ſo ordered, that the text, which was <hi>muſicated,</hi> was withall ſung in the natiue language, and was vnderſtood of euery one. And if when it ſhall be ſo ordered at this day, then were it not wholly againſt vs.</p>
               <p>The twelfth fault they find, is,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>12</hi> Of bowing the knee, and putting off the hat when one ſaith Ieſus.</note> for that we do not bow the knee, and put off the hat, as often as the name of Ieſus is named. Whereof wee are conſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to informe the Reader ſomething more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For it beareth a ſhew, as if therein they had no ſmall cauſe of offence in vs. Before all other things now, we doe teſtifie before God, that wee doe not doe any ſuch thing out of any diſdaine of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious name of Ieſus: but we doe it in reſpect of the wilworſhip which was founded in Poperie. Where the knee is bowed, and the hat is put off, whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the name of Ieſus is named: but when Chriſt is ſpoken, or the Sonne of God, then doth no man put off his hat: yea although ioyntly one doth name God the father, Sonne, and holy Ghoſt, the bleſſed Trinity, yet is there no man that taketh off his hat, neither doth any man bow the knee: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as yet God ſaith: <hi>I haue ſworne by my ſelfe, &amp;c. That e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery knee ſhall bow vnto me.</hi> Eſa. 45.23. Onely, when it is ſaid, Ieſus, then doe the folke take off their hats, and bend the knee: yea though it bee the name of <hi>Ieſus Syrach.</hi> In this wilworſhip would not our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers bee partakers; and therefore let fall the vſe wherein the wilworſhip conſiſteth: and that by vertue of the command we haue: <hi>Abſtaine from all appearance of euill.</hi> 1. Theſ. 5.20. But whereas it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:25112:103"/>
that it ſtandeth in the word of God expreſly written, that euery knee ſhould bow at the name of Ieſus: to this our anſwere is; If it ſtood expreſly in the word of God, that the knee ſhould bee bowed, or the hat be put off, as often as wee heard the name Ieſus ſpoken, then were wee indeed wicked people, for not performing it But wee doe not find ſuch a command any where. The ſaying of <hi>Paul</hi> is obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, where he ſaith of Chriſt: <hi>Wherefore God hath alſo highly exalted him, and giuen him a name aboue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery name, that at the name of Ieſus ſhould euery knee bow, both of things in heauen, and things in earth, and things vnder the earth: and that euery tongue ſhould confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lord, vnto the glory of the father.</hi> Phil. 2.9.10.11. But if it pleaſe the Reader to conſider the text throughly, then ſhall hee finde that the name Ieſus doth not intend the little word Ieſus: but the honour, power and Maieſty, which God hath giuen to the Lord Ieſus: that namely to him ſhall all creatures yeeld the honour of being their Lord, and muſt crouch and bow vnto him. For concerning the name or little word Ieſus, the ſame name was not firſt giuen vnto the Lord Chriſt at the time of his exaltation, but when he was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the eighth day, then was his name called Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Beſides this, ſo is not the name Ieſus, when the little word Ieſus is vnderſtood thereby: a name o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all names; that is, not ſuch a name which was only giuen to the Lord Ieſus: for it was a common name in vſe among the Iewes; as may well per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued out of <hi>Ieſus Sirach,</hi> and many places of the
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:25112:103"/>
Scripture. Theſe are two vnmoueable grounds, out of which it is cleare, that in the aboue cited ſaying, by the name Ieſus, is not to be vnderſtood the little word Ieſus; but the honour, power and Maieſty, which God gaue vnto Chriſt, after that hee raiſed him from the dead: as alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in another place declareth very plainely thus, where he ſaith: <hi>God hath raiſed Chriſt from the dead, and ſet him at his right hand in the heauenly places: far aboue all principalities, and powers, and might, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and euery thing that is named,</hi> (ſee Reader, this is the name aboue all names) <hi>not in this world onely, but alſo in that that is to come, and hath made all things ſubiect vnder his feet, and hath appointed him, &amp;c.</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. 1.20.21. Yea and indeed alſo in the former text which they alleage as making for them; <hi>Paul</hi> expounds his owne meaning, what it is which hee vnderſtand by the great name which God gaue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt after his reſurrection: namely, the name, that he ſhould bee a Lord ouer all creatures in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and vpon the earth: or as the words of <hi>Paul</hi> themſelues are: <hi>That euery tongue ſhould confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt is the Lord, vnto the glory of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Neither are we the firſt who doe ſo expound theſe words, but the old teachers, <hi>Origen, Chryſoſtom,</hi> and <hi>Baſill,</hi> and many moe, haue euen ſo expounded the ſame, many hundred of yeeres agone: which expoſition if it may take place, then can there bee nothing concluded out of the ſame; for the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the knee ſo often as the word Ieſus is nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, but it muſt be confeſſed, that ſuch a cuſtome
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:25112:104"/>
is taken vp from men: indeed vpon a good mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but yet from men, and that without any au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from the word of God. Therefore it cannot truly bee ſaid that they that diſcontinue ſuch a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome, doe deale contrary to the word of God ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: yet wee for our parts accuſe not the action, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it free in the liberty of a Chriſtian: and we do ſometimes vſe it our ſelues, as we ſee it behoofefull, to auoid offence. But why it is that we cannot giue all men ſatisfaction herein: euen this is the cauſe, becauſe others alſo doe not giue vs content. For e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen as they take offence, for that we do not alwaies bow the knee, and take off the hat, when the name Ieſus is named: euen ſo are wee offended on the contrary, that they do onely bow the knee and take off the hat when one ſaith Ieſus, and not in like manner when Chriſt or God is ſaid. Therefore it is the ſureſt courſe, that both of vs ceaſe together, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaying of <hi>Paul: Beare ye one anothers burthen, and ſo fulfill the law of Chriſt.</hi> Gal. 6.2.</p>

But on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſide our opponents hold certaine things for needfull (as the confeſſion in the eare; alſo the bowing of the knee at the word Ieſus, &amp;c.) which we eſteeme but for meere indifferent things.

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:25112:104"/>
alſo the beſt that is to be done in this matter, is, that the one ſide beareth with the other, till ſuch time as wee doe all of vs attaine to deeper vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding: euen as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> admoniſheth vs, where he ſaith: <hi>One beleeueth that hee may eate of all things: and another which is weake eateth herbes.
